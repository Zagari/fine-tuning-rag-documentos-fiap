            "Olena Bilozerska and her husband always knew they wanted children. She was 34 and they were ready to start trying when the war erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014. The couple joined the fight and decided a baby would have to wait. By the time Bilozerska left the military, she was 41 and told by doctors her chances of conceiving were next to none. It was too late. With the war in Ukraine about to mark its fourth anniversary, Ukraine’s birth rate is collapsing, with increasing number of people struggling with fertility or putting off the decision to have children. At the same time, losses are mounting on the frontlines, and millions of people who have fled as refugees have now settled abroad. The result is one of the world’s worst demographic crises. “It’s a catastrophe,” Ella Libanova, a leading Ukrainian demographer, told CNN. “No country can exist without people. Even before the war, Ukraine’s population density was low (and) very unevenly spread.” Libanova said Ukraine has lost around 10 million people since the start of the war – between those who have been killed, left the country or are living in areas under Russian occupation. And while the country’s birthrate has been declining for years – a common trend across Europe – it has now all but collapsed. Russia’s unprovoked aggression has forced millions of Ukrainians to put their lives on hold. But for many women, this decision can come at a huge cost. When she came back from the frontlines, Bilozerska was told that her chance of having her own baby was at best 5%. “The doctors advised me not to waste time and take a donor egg right away,” she said. Not keen on that idea, she started fertility treatment – even though the odds were stacked heavily against her. “Soldiers live one day at a time. They live to see the evening, to see the next day. They have urgent needs – where to get money for drones, for car repairs. They do not plan anything for the future,” Bilozerska told CNN in Kyiv. “I consider it my moral duty to tell (military) women that if they want children in the future, I would advise them to get checked and freeze their eggs. I share my story so that fewer women end up in such a predicament.” To maximize the odds of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure being successful, doctors usually try to retrieve between 10 and 15 eggs in each cycle. In Bilozerska’s case, they managed to get just one, warning her right away that the chances of it being healthy were small. After fertilizing it with her husband’s sperm, they once again cautioned her: The risks of it not working out were high. The next few days were torture, with the couple waiting to see if the embryo would survive. When it did, Bilozerska, then 42, was ready to take her only chance at having a baby. That’s when Russia launched itsfull-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a fully-trained military officer, Bilozerska was immediately needed back at the front. The embryo stayed in Kyiv, frozen and stored in a cryobank with roughly 10,000 others. “I went back to war, and I was so afraid that the clinic would be bombed, I called the clinic, I asked what would happen, whether the cryobank would be taken abroad, whether it was safe,” Bilozerska told CNN. She was reassured that the clinic had a reinforced wall protecting the embryos. It wouldn’t withstand a direct hit, but it would protect them from shrapnel and debris. Dr. Valery Zukin is one of the pioneers of reproductive medicine in Ukraine and the director of the clinic where Bilozerska’s embryo was stored. The clinic is called Nadiya, meaning Hope in Ukrainian. He told CNN the war is having devastating impact on Ukraine’s fertility rates. “I can see it with my own eyes. We are seeing more complications, more abnormalities, more difficulties carrying pregnancy to term,” he said, explaining that routine genetic testing on miscarried embryos has revealed that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities has grown sharply since the start of the war. Dr. Alla Baranenko, a reproductive specialist at the Nadiya clinic, said she is also seeing more cases of premature menopause in younger women. “The quality of eggs is poorer and their number is decreasing – and it’s because of stress and it’s not just my patients, it’s also the egg donors, who are women without any reproductive problems. And yet the quality of their eggs is poorer,” she said, adding that the quality of sperm of Ukrainian men, especially those coming back from the front, is also worse. “We have been preserving sperm for 30 years. When we compare the quality of the sperm of military personnel now with that of ordinary men before the war, it is, of course, worse. Stress also affects men, but it’s not just stress, it’s also the conditions they live in.” Iryna Ivanova had all the telltale signs of early pregnancy. But she didn’t want to tell her husband until she knew for sure. He was very excited about the possibility of having children, and Ivanova didn’t want to get his hopes up in case it was a false alarm. By the time she was certain she was carrying a child, it was too late to tell him. Pavlo Ivanov, her husband, the love of her life, and one of Ukraine’selite F-16 pilots, was killed in action on April 12 2025. When her daughter was born in December, Ivanova called her Yustyna – the name the couple picked together when fantasizing about having children. Yustyna has Pavlo’s light blue eyes and seems to have taken after him in her calmness. “When I heard her cry, that first moment, it was as if I began to breathe,” Ivanova told CNN, tears streaming down her face. “You can feel the greatest joy and the greatest pain, and you just get used to it being part of you and your life now.” Ukraine does not release its casualty data, but areport publishedin January by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank, estimated that between 100,000 and 140,000 Ukrainians have been killed since the start of the full-scale invasion four years ago. The country’s relatively high draft age and the exemption of the youngest draftees from the frontlines means the average age of a Ukrainian soldier is about 43 years, significantly older than in many western countries. Because of that, most of the men and women who are losing their lives on the front lines are married with children – and Ukraine is becoming a country of widows and orphans. Official statistics show there are now 59,000 children living without their biological parents in Ukraine, most of them in foster families. Oksana Borkun knows a lot about the stigma of being a young widow. Her husband Volodymyr Hunko was killed in Bakhmut in the summer of 2022. Having grown up in a culture where grief is meant to be private and women without husbands are often looked down upon, she has made it her mission to make the lives of Ukraine’s widows easier. Sitting in a cozy cafe in central Kyiv, Borkun and her two friends Juliia Seliutina and Olena Biletska, were sharing stories over cups of coffee and hot cocoa, as the cafe’s diesel generator – made necessary by Russia’s relentless destruction of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure  – hummed in the background. The three women, all widows, were brought together by their shared grief and desire to help others in the same situation. Their online support group for widows of military men now has more than 6,000 members, and they organize regular in-person meetups, memorial evenings and other events. Borkun is the driving force behind many of the projects, and it was she who convinced Biletska to get involved in a project that focuses on getting birthday gifts for children of fallen soldiers. “It so happened that (my husband) Vovchik and I didn’t have children, so I was afraid that it would be very painful for me. We wanted this child so much, but it didn’t work out … it turned out that (working on this project) helped me heal,” she said, adding that the group is now sending on average 200 gifts every month. A widow at 45, Biletska has made peace with the fact that she is unlikely to have her own baby. She and her husband tried for children and were seeking treatment when he went to war. “The war took away the years when I could have had children,” she told CNN. Iryna and Pavlo Ivanov were so set on having lots of children – definitely more than three, she told CNN. Ukraine’s fertility rate, or the number of children that are born to an average woman over her lifetime, has now dropped to below one, compared to 1.4 across Europe and 1.6 in the US. Even before the war, it was unusual for a young couple like the Ivanovs to contemplate having more than two children. They were exactly the kind of people Ukraine needed to improve its dire demographic crisis. But that dream died along with her husband. Seliutina said that their movement is trying to empower widowed women to become active members of the society – something that she believes will become especially important after the war ends and Ukraine will start rebuilding. Some 6 million people, mostly young women and children, have fled and officially registered as refugees abroad since the full-scale war first started in 2022. The vast majority are still living abroad, and Libanova said that the longer the conflict continues, the less likely it is that they will come back. “With each passing month, there is more and more destruction here and, on the other hand, more and more of our war migrants are adapting to their new life abroad. Fewer are returning,” she told CNN. The huge exodus is also a major brain drain for Ukraine. “I hope that the most qualified people will return. … The economy and infrastructure will need to be rebuilt. We will need workers, and mostly skilled ones. If we don’t have enough of these people, we will have to bring in foreigners, which may not be a bad thing. But I doubt that many skilled foreigners will come here in large numbers,” she said. Seliutina said this is where war widows, especially younger ones, can help secure Ukraine’s future. “The young women who have lost their loved ones, they know the price of loss. They know why our men went there and why they cannot leave the country now. We can’t just sit and wait for someone else to do something for us. We are no longer capable of that,” she said. Last year, as she turned 45, Bilozerska realized she was getting old. Not just for motherhood, but also for the war. She was serving as a sniper. “I really couldn’t do the combat work anymore. Most of the men (in my unit) are young athletes … of course, I couldn’t keep up with them anymore,” she told CNN. Her commanders have long been suggesting she’d take up a different position away from the frontlines, but she had been resisting. When her mother died, leaving her disabled father on his own, she knew it was time to come back to Kyiv. Her embryo was still in Nadiya, having waited for her for three years. “I felt that this was my last chance to have a child. I went to the clinic for my embryo. And that’s how Pavlus was born when I was 46,” she told CNN during a walk in a wintery Kyiv park. Baranenko, who treated Bilozerska at the Nadiya clinic, said that of all the cases she has worked on, it’s her story stuck with her the most. Over her 20-year career, she has helped to conceive 5,000 babies. Pavlus, wrapped up warm and looking like a tiny snowman in his powder blue snowsuit, looked at her as she gently picked him up for a cuddle. “His middle name is Bohdan, meaning ‘a gift from God,’” she said. “You pick him up and just melt. He reaches out to you, he smiles and you just go crazy over him, it’s impossible to describe.”\n",

            "If Team USA is looking for inspiration ahead of the men’s Olympic hockey final Sunday against fierce rivals Canada, it need look no further than the iconic exploits of the “Miracle on Ice” heroes from 1980. It’s been 46 years since the last time the United States won gold in the competition, but what a journey it was for the Americans along the way to glory at Lake Placid in New York. Against all the odds and at the height of the Cold War, a group of mostly amateur and young college-age players took to the ice for their country going on to defeat the mighty Soviet Union, then far and away the best team in the world and seeking a fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. It was the ultimate David-versus-Goliath contest, and it would result in one of the greatest and most stunning upsets in sports history – a win that also gave a timely boost to the country at large. “Once we went to Lake Placid, we were just going in to play in a hockey tournament, knowing what was going on in the country, but that was our life back then. We lived with gas lines, we lived with high unemployment, high interest rates,” Jack O’Callahan, a key defenseman on that history-making team told CNN Sports. “We knew it wasn’t very good, but that being said, we were hockey players, we were going to play in the Olympics in Lake Placid, and we were focused on that,” he added. A world away from the era of the NHL superstars that we see today, the US – under its legendary coach Herb Brooks – was the overwhelming underdog going into that game. Few, if any, gave them a chance against the all-conquering Soviets, especially given the fact the American team had been humbled 10-3 in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden just days before the Games started. On the surface, that defeat should have been demoralizing, but the reality was very different. It served as one huge wake-up call. If motivation was needed to put things right, then this was it. “I was competitive. I was physical. I was a pretty talented player as well. I led the team in penalty minutes all year. I didn’t really like the Russians very much and they had beaten us up pretty good in New York. If I had a chance to run one of those guys over, I was going to do it. But believe me, they were not easy to run over. They were big, strong, incredibly talented, cohesive unit,” O’Callahan said. The now 68 year-old – who also played in the NHL with the Chicago Blackhawks and the New Jersey Devils – was recently reunited with his former teammates for a newly -released Netflix documentary, “Miracle: The Boys of ’80,” which took the players back to the scene of their greatest triumph. Having recently returned from injury, O’Callahan played a key role in that epic win with a huge check on a Soviet player that led to the goal that tied the game up at 1-1. Team USA then trailed 3-2 entering the third period before hitting back in style to win. It would be captain Mike Eruzione who sealed a sensational 4-3 victory with 10 minutes left in the game. “I don’t know if I’ve ever felt that euphoric about anything else playing hockey. It was just an outpour of genuine, authentic emotion and everybody was so excited and like I said, euphoria, but we had to get it together the next day in practice because we had another game to play and we sure wouldn’t be having this conversation if we had lost that game against Finland,” O’Callahan reflected. While the shock victory over the Soviets grabbed the attention of the world, it wasn’t enough to secure the gold medal for the United States who then had to face Finland for a chance to win the country’s first Olympics gold since 1960.

            "Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life in prison Thursday after a court found him guilty of leading an insurrection during his short-lived imposition of martial law, which plunged the country into political chaos and threatened to unravel decades of democracy. The verdict closes a chapter of one of South Korea’s biggest political crises, a saga that has been full of dramatic twists that have tested the country’s democratic guardrails. On December 3, 2024, Yoon, 65,declared martial lawin a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within opposition parties that were sympathetic to North Korea. Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopter and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with lawmakers and parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber, in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television. Yoon’s shocking declaration revived dark memories of the country’s authoritarian past, plunged South Korea into a constitutional crisis and was widely condemned as striking at the heart of the nation’s democracy. He reversed course within six hours, after lawmakers forced their way into parliament and voted unanimously to block it. Since the late 1980s, South Korea has transformed into a robust democracy, with regular protests, free speech, fair elections and peaceful transfers of power. The country has also since grown into a major player in the global economy and remains acrucial US ally in Asia. But its domestic political scene remains deeply polarized and fractious, with presidents on both sides of the political divide often facing calls for impeachment, criminal investigations and prosecution. A crowd of Yoon supporters gathered outside the the Seoul Central District Court, watching proceedings on a big screen as it was broadcast live to the nation. Presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon said it was clear that Yoon’s intention in declaring martial law was to paralyze the National Assembly for a significant period of time, considering the words he used in the military decree and the fact he tried to arrest political opponents, including the leader of the opposition Democratic Party and his own ruling party’s leader Han Dong-hoon. The very act of dispatching armed soldiers to the parliament building and transporting them by helicopter constituted acts of insurrection, Ji said. Former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun was also found guilty Thursday of playing a major role in the insurrection and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Kim had previouslytaken responsibilityfor ordering soldiers to enact martial law. Four other former military and police officials received sentences of between 3 and 18 years. In a statement, Yoon’s lawyers criticized what they called procedural violations and said the ruling lacked consistency. “You may be able to deceive the public for a while and draw cheers in the public square, but the truth will one day be revealed in the court of history. We will never yield to distortion and lies, and we will fight to the very end,” the statement said. Song Hwa, 35, who rushed to the National Assembly on December 3 with her husband after hearing Yoon’s declaration, said the verdict was an “extremely important decision” that “will send a powerful message to the public.” Cho Kuk, leader of the liberal-leaning Rebuilding Korea Party, said Yoon “tried to destroy South Korea’s democracy.” “There are many places where democracy is faltering,” he added. “South Korea’s experience shows that the power to protect and recover democracy lies within the people.” Yoon, who can appeal the ruling, had denied the insurrection charge, saying his imposition of martial law was meant to alert the public to paralysing political gridlock caused by the opposition party’s majority in the National Assembly and its impeachment of several senior officials. “The National Assembly brought about the national crisis and there was no other way but to awaken the people,” he said in closing statements, arguing that as president he was exercising his constitutional authority. Yoon, a former prosecutor, called the charge “a delusion and a work of fiction.” He had argued that there was no real intent to arrest lawmakers, no heavy weaponry was deployed, and there were no serious casualties. Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. Prosecutors had sought the death penalty, a largely symbolic move as the country hasn’t executed anyone in decades. “The series of actions destroyed the liberal democratic constitutional order,” special counsel Park Eok-su said in closing arguments. “The shock, fear, anxiety, wounds, and sense of loss suffered by the people are beyond description,” he added. Prosecutors said Yoon had not shown remorse and there remained a risk that his invocation of emergency martial law could be repeated in future. “The gravity of the crime of insurrection threatens the very existence of the community,” prosectors said. Yoon was firstdetained in January2025 after resisting attempts to arrest him in aweeks-long standoffwith authorities at his home in Seoul. He was the first president in South Korean history to be arrested while in office. He was impeached 11 days after declaring martial law and removed from office four months later. Yoon continues to face multiple charges related to his martial law declaration and for other actions during his time as president. Last month, Yoon wassentenced to five years in prisonfor obstructing authorities trying to detain him, abuse of power and fabricating a document. Yoon also faces charges of aiding an enemy state after prosecutors claimed hedeployed secret dronesto provoke a military conflict with North Korea as a ploy for declaring martial law. Other key Yoon allies have already been prosecuted for their roles in the martial law decree. Last month, former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to23 years in prisonbecoming the first Yoon administration official convicted of insurrection charges. And last week, former interior minister Lee Sang-min was sentenced to seven years in prison for participating in a rebellion. Yoon’s wifeKim Keon Heeis also in prison, serving a one-year-and-eight-month sentence for an unrelated charge of bribery. Thursday’s verdict, however, marks the first time in 30 years that South Korea has sentenced a leader for insurrection.

            "Rondale Moore, an NFL receiver who had season-ending training camp knee injuries in each of the last two years after a standout college career at Purdue and a promising start with the Arizona Cardinals, was found dead Saturday, authorities said. He was 25. Police said Moore died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. Moore was found dead in the garage of a property in his hometown of New Albany, police chief Todd Bailey said. The death remains under investigation. Floyd County Coroner Matthew Tomlin also confirmed Moore’s death. He said an autopsy would be conducted on Sunday. After being traded to the Atlanta Falcons in 2024, Moore dislocated his right knee during training camp and never played for them. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2025, but he blew out his left knee while returning a punt in their first exhibition game and spent another full season on injured reserve. Moore was so distraught after immediately realizing the seriousness of that injury that he slammed his hand down on a cart so hard the sound was audible throughout the stadium. The Vikings said they had spoken with Moore’s family to offer condolences and support. “I am devastated by the news of Rondale’s death. While Rondale had been a member of the Vikings for a short time, he was someone we came to know well and care about deeply,” coach Kevin O’Connell said in a statement distributed by the team. “He was a humble, soft-spoken, and respectful young man who was proud of his Indiana roots. As a player, he was disciplined, dedicated and resilient despite facing adversity multiple times as injuries sidelined him throughout his career. We are all heartbroken by the fact he won’t continue to live out his NFL dream and we won’t all have a chance to watch him flourish.” In a statement, the Cardinals said they were “devastated and heartbroken.” “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, teammates, and everyone who loved him and had the privilege of knowing such a special person,” the team said ina social media post. Moore grew up in New Albany, just across the Indiana border from Louisville, Kentucky, and was a first team All-American as a freshman at Purdue in 2018. “Rondale Moore was a complete joy to coach. The ultimate competitor who wouldn’t back down from any challenge. Rondale had a work ethic unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation. We all loved Rondale; we loved his smile and his competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact,” Louisville coach Jeff Brohm saidon social media. Brohm was the coach at Purdue when Moore played there. Drafted in the second round by the Cardinals in 2021, Moore had 1,201 receiving yards and three touchdowns plus 249 rushing yards and one score over three seasons. He served as their primary returner for kickoffs and punts as a rookie before injuries pushed him away from that role. “Can’t even begin to fathom or process this,” former Cardinals teammate J.J. Watt said onsocial media. “There’s just no way. Way too soon. Way too special. So much left to give. Rest in peace Rondale.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story corrected a misidentified photo.

The fatal brawl was caught on video, which showed several masked people kicking and punching a man on the ground, causing widespread shock and anger in France. Authorities have charged two people with murder in connection with Deranque’s death, and altogether 11 have been arrested. The incident has also sparked a diplomatic spat between France and Italy, after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Deranque’s death was caused “by groups linked to left-wing extremism” and condemned “a climate of ideological hatred sweeping several nations.” This is not the first time that Kushner, father of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been summoned amid criticism from the French authorities. In August 2025, the Foreign Ministrysummoned Kushnerafter he accused the French government of a “lack of sufficient action” in confronting antisemitism.\n",

It was impossible to recreate the exact same home piece by piece, but with everything in the home catalogued by Samuel, they got close. “We found some new fabrics and rugs to change that up, and similar replacements for vintage pieces that we lost,” she explained. “But everything else remained the same.” As Moore and Goldsmith continue work on their property, they’ve also seen their neighbors return and make progress, too. Moore says there’s an “undefeatable spirit” across the wider city. “People love to dog LA for every reason, and some of it is warranted. But when push comes to shove, people show up for their neighbors,” she said. “I don’t think that was ever more evident than during the fires.” With the release of the latest edition of the magazine, AD’s editor in chief Amy Astley unveiled the launch of a new fundraising initiative, Design Making a Difference, partnering with Habitat for Humanity and the Foothill Catalog Foundation, to help rebuild homes lost in the fires. The issue also features a guide to the city with recommendations from famous Angelinos including Kristen Stewart — the issue’s cover star — Lisa Kudrow and Noah Wyle. “It’s a personal tour with a lot of heart,” wrote Astley in her editor’s note.\n",

            "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled Wednesday about whether his company intentionally designed Instagram to be addictive, in front of the young woman accusing Meta and YouTube of hooking her as a child and damaging her mental health. The Meta CEO, testifying before a jury for the first time on years-old claims about social media harming children’s mental health, said he believed he has navigated the safety of young users “in a reasonable way.” But parents who traveled from across the country for the trial, saying their children had been hurt or died because of social media, painted a different picture outside the Los Angeles courtroom, describing a company that they say preyed on and exploited their children in the name of profits. The outcome of this trial, in which a young woman, “Kaley,” accuses Meta and YouTube of designing addictive features to hook her as a small child, could serve as a bellwether for hundreds of other cases. If the companies lose, they could be on the hook for potentially billions in damages and forced to make changes to platforms that have shaped how many people live. Zuckerberg exited from a back door of the courthouse after concluding more than five hours of testimony on Wednesday. Before the trial began, nearly a dozenparents who say their children were harmedgathered hands outside the courthouse before Zuckerberg arrived. Zuckerberg entered through the front door of the Los Angeles Superior courthouse around 8:30 a.m. local time, past a swarm of parents, media and jurors also waiting in line to enter. He did not respond to a question about what his message would be to parents who say their children were harmed by social media. Kaley herself was also in the tightly packed courtroom to hear Zuckerberg’s testimony. Her lawyer, Mark Lanier, previously said she would not be present for much of the trial proceedings because she has social anxiety and difficulty being around crowds, although she is expected to testify later in the trial. At one point in the testimony, Lanier pointed to Zuckerberg’s 2024 congressional testimony that “the existing body of scientific work” has not shown a link between social media and worse mental health outcomes for young people. “We get feedback from a handful of different stakeholders, including people who study wellbeing,” Zuckerberg said. “I took into account all of that info and I think I navigated this in a reasonable way.” Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom during a break, Julianna Arnold said it was “surreal” to see Zuckerberg testify, after years of calling on the company to make greater changes. Arnoldtracesthe death of her 17-year-old daughter Coco to Instagram. “The intention of the company was to prey on teens … exploit them so they can make greater profits,” Arnold said. “That was done intentionally, not by accident.” At the end of his questioning, Lanier brought out a dramatic prop: a poster multiple feet long, held by seven people, with hundreds of photos Kaley had posted to Instagram, as a way of hammering home her compulsive use of the platform. Zuckerberg was pressed on Wednesday about whether children younger than 13 have access to Instagram. The app technically requires users to be 13 to sign up, and Zuckerberg said younger children are “not allowed on Instagram.” But Lanier showed an internal document from 2015 that estimated over 4 million Instagram users were under 13, which it said represented “30% of all 10-12 year olds in the US.” Lanier has said the now-20-year-old plaintiff, Kaley, began using Instagram at age 9. Lanier pointed out that it wasn’t until December 2019 that Instagram began asking new users to input a birthdate when signing up; previously, it just asked them to confirm they were above the age of 13. Instagram in August 2021 started asking existing users to provide a birthdate if they hadn’t done so previously, as part of a safety push for young people. That means Kaley wasn’t asked for her age at all when she joined the platform. Zuckerberg said that in 2019, before the birthdate rule was implemented, there was “some concern around privacy,” but he thinks they eventually landed on the right policy. Lanier has said Kaley sometimes used Instagram for “several hours a day” and was once on the platform for more than 16 hours in a single day, despite her mother’s attempts to curb her use.Kaley claims the app’saddictive features led her to develop anxiety, body dysmorphia and suicidal thoughts and that she experienced bullying and sextortion on Instagram. A Meta spokesperson has said “we strongly disagree” with the allegations in Kaley’s lawsuit and “are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.” The company’s lawyer has argued that it was Kaley’s difficult family life, rather than social media, that caused her mental health challenges. YouTube also denies the lawsuit’s claims. “The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s mental health struggles,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement ahead of Zuckerberg’s testimony. “The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media.” Meta has also pointed to safety features, such as parental oversight tools and “teen accounts,” which implement default privacy settings and content restrictions for users under the age of 18. Lanier asked Zuckerberg whether a company should “prey upon” people who come from difficult backgrounds or are “less fortunate in educational opportunities.” “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people who use its services,” Zuckerberg replied. The exchange got somewhat heated when Lanier questioned whether Zuckerberg and Meta set goals to maximize time spent on the app. The Meta CEO said time-specific goals existed “earlier on in the company” but it then shifted to focus on “utility and value.” “There’s a basic assumption I have that if something is valuable, then people will do it more,” Zuckerberg said on the stand. Lanier showed an internal email from December 2015 in which Zuckerberg referenceda three-year plan for the company, which included “Time - +10% for Instagram.” “We used to give teams goals… we changed that because I don’t think it’s the best way to run the company,” Zuckerberg said in response.He argued that Lanier was mischaracterizing his approach from a decade ago.

Kyiv said that such actions were “provocative, irresponsible, ‌and threaten the energy security of the entire region.” Throughout the war that began ⁠with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Tuesday, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted. Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way. In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed ⁠shipments through Ukraine’s oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine’s main ‌Black Sea port to the EU. Since October last year, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking ⁠out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long ​blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures.\n",
