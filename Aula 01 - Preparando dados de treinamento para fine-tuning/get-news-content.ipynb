            "British foreign minister Yvette Cooper on Thursday condemned as “totally unjustifiable” the10-year sentencegiven to a British couple in Iran forspying,saying the government would continue to press for their release. Craig and Lindsay Foreman had been charged with espionage afterIranaccused them of gathering information in several parts of the country. “We will pursue this case relentlessly with the Iranian government until we see Craig and Lindsay Foreman safely returned to the UK and reunited with their family,” Cooper said in a statement. The Foremans were arrested on January 3 of last year while traveling through Iran on a global motorcycle journey. Iranian state media announced their detention the following month over espionage charges and they have now been held for more than 13 months. Joe Bennett, Lindsay’s son, said in a separate statement the couple had appeared at a three-hour trial on October 27, in which they were not allowed to present a defense. “We have seen no evidence to support the charge of espionage,” he said, adding that the family was deeply concerned about the couple’s welfare and the lack of transparency in the judicial process. Bennett called on the British government to “act decisively and use every available avenue” to secure their release. The Iranian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sentencing. According to a family statement, the couple have been held for extended periods without being able to communicate. They have had limited or delayed access to legal representation, periods of solitary confinement and delays in receiving funds for basic necessities. They also reported disrupted or canceled consular visits. Cooper, whose office did not comment on the disruption, said they would continue to provide consular assistance. Lindsay Foreman has been held in the women’s section of Tehran’s Evin Prison, while her husband Craig has been held in its political wing. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have in recent years detained foreign and dual nationals, typically on espionage or national security charges. Human rights organizations say the authorities use such arrests as leverage in disputes with other countries, a practice they describe as part of a broader pattern of politically motivated detentions. Tehran has rejected those accusations and said the cases involved legitimate security concerns.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/20/style/method-dressing-red-carpet\n",
            "For the past few years now, movie stars have publicized their films in promotional drag called “method dressing.” Picking up on the themes or cliches of their films, they appear on the red carpet in looks that function as goofy in-jokes – corsets on Margot Robbie for the bodice- ripping update on “Wuthering Heights,” and ensembles that telegraph “good” and “evil” for Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo’s “Wicked” two-parter. Increasingly, they look less like movie stars than guests at a very expensive costume ball. No star is a more committed method dresser than Robbie. Working with stylist Andrew Mukamal, Robbie adopteda wardrobe of Barbie-inspired ensemblesto promote the 2023 blockbuster, sometimes tasking designers with recreating an exact Barbie costume. It was hokey and over-the-top, but so is the doll herself, director Greta Gerwig gently reminded us, and the sight of Robbie in hot pink skirt suits, minidresses and gowns set the tone of the film as finely drawn pop cultural froth. Robbie’s methodology has continued with red carpet appearances for her starring role inEmerald Fennell’s sudsy adaptation of “Wuthering Heights.”There are corsets, puffed sleeves and little old timey trinkets that speak of her and co-star Jacob Elordi’s bond. This has been far less effective than her Barbie-girl, Barbie-world looks, in part because the movie is more serious (allegedly a bookish romance –allegedly!) and because the universe of the Emily Brontë book isn’t known for its extravagant clothes, unlike that of Marie Antoinette’s or Regency-era set “Bridgerton.” It is unclear what Robbie’s ensembles are meant to tell us, except that she is promoting a period drama – which period, the clothes do not say. In one moment, Robbie wore a look that puts a spotlight on an emerging designer,Dilara Findikoglu, who created a dress braided with synthetic hair, for the film’s London premiere. At another moment, she wore one of the ugliest Chanel dresses in recent memory (see above). Hollywood is desperate to get audiences back in movie theater chairs, and you can’t blame actors for doing anything to drum up excitement, whether that’s Timothée Chalamet summitting the Sphere, which was transformed into a giant ping pong ball, in Las Vegas to promote “Marty Supreme” or wearing a hideous Chrome Hearts suit inorange homage to his titular character. Chalamet also went full method dress for hisBob Dylan biopic, “A Complete Unknown,”recreating hilariously deep-cut Dylan looks, like a goatee and scarf appearance at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. And Erivo and Grande could have relied on their strange but touching bond to get us to see the “Wicked” movies. But their coordinating overt looks — ONE is evil and the OTHER is “good” and you know because of the COLORS they’re wearing! – showed us just how much they wanted us there. For “Marty Supreme,” “A Complete Unknown” and “Wicked,” the marketing desperation paid off: all were bonafide box office hits. Method dressing has been popularized by Law Roach, the self-styled image architect who made vintage into the ultimate celebrity fashion flex back when big name brands refused to lend clothing to him. Roach is an expert at using clothes to tell a story, though his yarns tend to be subtler – that Lindsey Lohan isready to be takenseriously as an adult, or Celine Dion may be a grand diva, but she has asense of humor. He put Zendaya, his most famous client, in a vintage robot suit for “Dune” and little tennis ball heels for the erotic tennis thriller “Challengers,” enhancing her image as a dedicated actress who will throw herself into any kind of part, whether it’s the big blockbuster or the weird indie. But now it’s clear this sartorial trick is a marketing gimmick, and it feels less like style or fashion and simply like costume. It can still feel elegant: look at Chalamet at the Palm Springs Film Festival in January, where he wore a tailored Givenchy suit in keeping with his character and midcentury fashion, which has garnered a cult following among menswear fanatics. The look tells us where style might go next – a more nuanced conversation. For the most part, though, method dressing looks dated but we are thankfully entering an era less about performative dressing and more about dressing with some dignity. Actors who look more of the moment are Ayo Edebiri, Teyana Taylor and Jennifer Lawrence – who see dressing for a film premiere or awards show less about creating an outrageous look, and more about asserting their artistry and originality. It’s hard not to look at those loose, louche red carpets of the 1990s, when Julia Roberts could wear an oversized men’s suit to accept a Golden Globe and Sharon Stone could stuff a Gap button-up into a ruched satin skirt and land on the best-dressed list. But there is too much money on the field (or on the carpet, as it were) for stars ever to return to that freedom – even method dressing is often the result of high stakes brand deals, which are necessary in leaner times for entertainment. We have been praising too many actors for wearing clothes that are simply ugly. Don’t we deserve some beauty?\n",

            "Olena Bilozerska and her husband always knew they wanted children. She was 34 and they were ready to start trying when the war erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014. The couple joined the fight and decided a baby would have to wait. By the time Bilozerska left the military, she was 41 and told by doctors her chances of conceiving were next to none. It was too late. With the war in Ukraine about to mark its fourth anniversary, Ukraine’s birth rate is collapsing, with increasing number of people struggling with fertility or putting off the decision to have children. At the same time, losses are mounting on the frontlines, and millions of people who have fled as refugees have now settled abroad. The result is one of the world’s worst demographic crises. “It’s a catastrophe,” Ella Libanova, a leading Ukrainian demographer, told CNN. “No country can exist without people. Even before the war, Ukraine’s population density was low (and) very unevenly spread.” Libanova said Ukraine has lost around 10 million people since the start of the war – between those who have been killed, left the country or are living in areas under Russian occupation. And while the country’s birthrate has been declining for years – a common trend across Europe – it has now all but collapsed. Russia’s unprovoked aggression has forced millions of Ukrainians to put their lives on hold. But for many women, this decision can come at a huge cost. When she came back from the frontlines, Bilozerska was told that her chance of having her own baby was at best 5%. “The doctors advised me not to waste time and take a donor egg right away,” she said. Not keen on that idea, she started fertility treatment – even though the odds were stacked heavily against her. “Soldiers live one day at a time. They live to see the evening, to see the next day. They have urgent needs – where to get money for drones, for car repairs. They do not plan anything for the future,” Bilozerska told CNN in Kyiv. “I consider it my moral duty to tell (military) women that if they want children in the future, I would advise them to get checked and freeze their eggs. I share my story so that fewer women end up in such a predicament.” To maximize the odds of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure being successful, doctors usually try to retrieve between 10 and 15 eggs in each cycle. In Bilozerska’s case, they managed to get just one, warning her right away that the chances of it being healthy were small. After fertilizing it with her husband’s sperm, they once again cautioned her: The risks of it not working out were high. The next few days were torture, with the couple waiting to see if the embryo would survive. When it did, Bilozerska, then 42, was ready to take her only chance at having a baby. That’s when Russia launched itsfull-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a fully-trained military officer, Bilozerska was immediately needed back at the front. The embryo stayed in Kyiv, frozen and stored in a cryobank with roughly 10,000 others. “I went back to war, and I was so afraid that the clinic would be bombed, I called the clinic, I asked what would happen, whether the cryobank would be taken abroad, whether it was safe,” Bilozerska told CNN. She was reassured that the clinic had a reinforced wall protecting the embryos. It wouldn’t withstand a direct hit, but it would protect them from shrapnel and debris. Dr. Valery Zukin is one of the pioneers of reproductive medicine in Ukraine and the director of the clinic where Bilozerska’s embryo was stored. The clinic is called Nadiya, meaning Hope in Ukrainian. He told CNN the war is having devastating impact on Ukraine’s fertility rates. “I can see it with my own eyes. We are seeing more complications, more abnormalities, more difficulties carrying pregnancy to term,” he said, explaining that routine genetic testing on miscarried embryos has revealed that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities has grown sharply since the start of the war. Dr. Alla Baranenko, a reproductive specialist at the Nadiya clinic, said she is also seeing more cases of premature menopause in younger women. “The quality of eggs is poorer and their number is decreasing – and it’s because of stress and it’s not just my patients, it’s also the egg donors, who are women without any reproductive problems. And yet the quality of their eggs is poorer,” she said, adding that the quality of sperm of Ukrainian men, especially those coming back from the front, is also worse. “We have been preserving sperm for 30 years. When we compare the quality of the sperm of military personnel now with that of ordinary men before the war, it is, of course, worse. Stress also affects men, but it’s not just stress, it’s also the conditions they live in.” Iryna Ivanova had all the telltale signs of early pregnancy. But she didn’t want to tell her husband until she knew for sure. He was very excited about the possibility of having children, and Ivanova didn’t want to get his hopes up in case it was a false alarm. By the time she was certain she was carrying a child, it was too late to tell him. Pavlo Ivanov, her husband, the love of her life, and one of Ukraine’selite F-16 pilots, was killed in action on April 12 2025. When her daughter was born in December, Ivanova called her Yustyna – the name the couple picked together when fantasizing about having children. Yustyna has Pavlo’s light blue eyes and seems to have taken after him in her calmness. “When I heard her cry, that first moment, it was as if I began to breathe,” Ivanova told CNN, tears streaming down her face. “You can feel the greatest joy and the greatest pain, and you just get used to it being part of you and your life now.” Ukraine does not release its casualty data, but areport publishedin January by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US-based think tank, estimated that between 100,000 and 140,000 Ukrainians have been killed since the start of the full-scale invasion four years ago. The country’s relatively high draft age and the exemption of the youngest draftees from the frontlines means the average age of a Ukrainian soldier is about 43 years, significantly older than in many western countries. Because of that, most of the men and women who are losing their lives on the front lines are married with children – and Ukraine is becoming a country of widows and orphans. Official statistics show there are now 59,000 children living without their biological parents in Ukraine, most of them in foster families. Oksana Borkun knows a lot about the stigma of being a young widow. Her husband Volodymyr Hunko was killed in Bakhmut in the summer of 2022. Having grown up in a culture where grief is meant to be private and women without husbands are often looked down upon, she has made it her mission to make the lives of Ukraine’s widows easier. Sitting in a cozy cafe in central Kyiv, Borkun and her two friends Juliia Seliutina and Olena Biletska, were sharing stories over cups of coffee and hot cocoa, as the cafe’s diesel generator – made necessary by Russia’s relentless destruction of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure  – hummed in the background. The three women, all widows, were brought together by their shared grief and desire to help others in the same situation. Their online support group for widows of military men now has more than 6,000 members, and they organize regular in-person meetups, memorial evenings and other events. Borkun is the driving force behind many of the projects, and it was she who convinced Biletska to get involved in a project that focuses on getting birthday gifts for children of fallen soldiers. “It so happened that (my husband) Vovchik and I didn’t have children, so I was afraid that it would be very painful for me. We wanted this child so much, but it didn’t work out … it turned out that (working on this project) helped me heal,” she said, adding that the group is now sending on average 200 gifts every month. A widow at 45, Biletska has made peace with the fact that she is unlikely to have her own baby. She and her husband tried for children and were seeking treatment when he went to war. “The war took away the years when I could have had children,” she told CNN. Iryna and Pavlo Ivanov were so set on having lots of children – definitely more than three, she told CNN. Ukraine’s fertility rate, or the number of children that are born to an average woman over her lifetime, has now dropped to below one, compared to 1.4 across Europe and 1.6 in the US. Even before the war, it was unusual for a young couple like the Ivanovs to contemplate having more than two children. They were exactly the kind of people Ukraine needed to improve its dire demographic crisis. But that dream died along with her husband. Seliutina said that their movement is trying to empower widowed women to become active members of the society – something that she believes will become especially important after the war ends and Ukraine will start rebuilding. Some 6 million people, mostly young women and children, have fled and officially registered as refugees abroad since the full-scale war first started in 2022. The vast majority are still living abroad, and Libanova said that the longer the conflict continues, the less likely it is that they will come back. “With each passing month, there is more and more destruction here and, on the other hand, more and more of our war migrants are adapting to their new life abroad. Fewer are returning,” she told CNN. The huge exodus is also a major brain drain for Ukraine. “I hope that the most qualified people will return. … The economy and infrastructure will need to be rebuilt. We will need workers, and mostly skilled ones. If we don’t have enough of these people, we will have to bring in foreigners, which may not be a bad thing. But I doubt that many skilled foreigners will come here in large numbers,” she said. Seliutina said this is where war widows, especially younger ones, can help secure Ukraine’s future. “The young women who have lost their loved ones, they know the price of loss. They know why our men went there and why they cannot leave the country now. We can’t just sit and wait for someone else to do something for us. We are no longer capable of that,” she said. Last year, as she turned 45, Bilozerska realized she was getting old. Not just for motherhood, but also for the war. She was serving as a sniper. “I really couldn’t do the combat work anymore. Most of the men (in my unit) are young athletes … of course, I couldn’t keep up with them anymore,” she told CNN. Her commanders have long been suggesting she’d take up a different position away from the frontlines, but she had been resisting. When her mother died, leaving her disabled father on his own, she knew it was time to come back to Kyiv. Her embryo was still in Nadiya, having waited for her for three years. “I felt that this was my last chance to have a child. I went to the clinic for my embryo. And that’s how Pavlus was born when I was 46,” she told CNN during a walk in a wintery Kyiv park. Baranenko, who treated Bilozerska at the Nadiya clinic, said that of all the cases she has worked on, it’s her story stuck with her the most. Over her 20-year career, she has helped to conceive 5,000 babies. Pavlus, wrapped up warm and looking like a tiny snowman in his powder blue snowsuit, looked at her as she gently picked him up for a cuddle. “His middle name is Bohdan, meaning ‘a gift from God,’” she said. “You pick him up and just melt. He reaches out to you, he smiles and you just go crazy over him, it’s impossible to describe.”\n",

            "Some people will go to extreme lengths to avoid paying for regular garbage collection – and sometimes they enlist help from man’s best friend. Authorities in Sicily, Italy, have released footage of a dog carrying garbage to a rogue land dump near Catania. The cunning canine can be seen carrying a large bag of trash with his teeth and gingerly leaving it on the roadside, according to video released by the Catania municipality Thursday. “Inventiveness… can never be an alibi for incivility,” the local authority said in a post on Facebook. “The environmental unit of Catania’s municipal police has released two videos recorded by surveillance cameras in which a dog is seen depositing a bag of waste in the street,” the post read. “This behavior is both cunning and doubly unfair, because in addition to littering the city, it attempts to evade the rules by exploiting the unwitting four-legged friend. Respect for urban decorum and the environment is everyone’s duty.” The man has been identified and fined, according to the post. The episode underscores what is a burgeoning problem across Italy. The situation is particularly bad in the southern provinces and islands, where garbage collection is sometimes as low as 57%, meaning garbage can be left in dumpsters and trash cans for days. The capital Rome has the highest rate of garbage tax evasion, according to the authorities, followed by Naples. Rates of collection are much higher in the northern regions of Italy, where rates of evasion are considerably lower, according to the Guardia di Finanza (Financial Police). Each year, nearly 10,000 waste related offenses, including illegal dumping, burning and burying are recorded each year, according to the Legambiente environmental group, prompting many municipalities to set up surveillance camera traps to monitor illegal activity. Fines for illegal dumping range from €1,500 ($1,770) to €18,000 ($21,200) and in some cases carry criminal charges. Illegal dumping is often tied to organized crime syndicates who are known as the eco-mafia by law enforcement.\n",

            "If Team USA is looking for inspiration ahead of the men’s Olympic hockey final Sunday against fierce rivals Canada, it need look no further than the iconic exploits of the “Miracle on Ice” heroes from 1980. It’s been 46 years since the last time the United States won gold in the competition, but what a journey it was for the Americans along the way to glory at Lake Placid in New York. Against all the odds and at the height of the Cold War, a group of mostly amateur and young college-age players took to the ice for their country going on to defeat the mighty Soviet Union, then far and away the best team in the world and seeking a fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. It was the ultimate David-versus-Goliath contest, and it would result in one of the greatest and most stunning upsets in sports history – a win that also gave a timely boost to the country at large. “Once we went to Lake Placid, we were just going in to play in a hockey tournament, knowing what was going on in the country, but that was our life back then. We lived with gas lines, we lived with high unemployment, high interest rates,” Jack O’Callahan, a key defenseman on that history-making team told CNN Sports. “We knew it wasn’t very good, but that being said, we were hockey players, we were going to play in the Olympics in Lake Placid, and we were focused on that,” he added. A world away from the era of the NHL superstars that we see today, the US – under its legendary coach Herb Brooks – was the overwhelming underdog going into that game. Few, if any, gave them a chance against the all-conquering Soviets, especially given the fact the American team had been humbled 10-3 in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden just days before the Games started. On the surface, that defeat should have been demoralizing, but the reality was very different. It served as one huge wake-up call. If motivation was needed to put things right, then this was it. “I was competitive. I was physical. I was a pretty talented player as well. I led the team in penalty minutes all year. I didn’t really like the Russians very much and they had beaten us up pretty good in New York. If I had a chance to run one of those guys over, I was going to do it. But believe me, they were not easy to run over. They were big, strong, incredibly talented, cohesive unit,” O’Callahan said. The now 68 year-old – who also played in the NHL with the Chicago Blackhawks and the New Jersey Devils – was recently reunited with his former teammates for a newly -released Netflix documentary, “Miracle: The Boys of ’80,” which took the players back to the scene of their greatest triumph. Having recently returned from injury, O’Callahan played a key role in that epic win with a huge check on a Soviet player that led to the goal that tied the game up at 1-1. Team USA then trailed 3-2 entering the third period before hitting back in style to win. It would be captain Mike Eruzione who sealed a sensational 4-3 victory with 10 minutes left in the game. “I don’t know if I’ve ever felt that euphoric about anything else playing hockey. It was just an outpour of genuine, authentic emotion and everybody was so excited and like I said, euphoria, but we had to get it together the next day in practice because we had another game to play and we sure wouldn’t be having this conversation if we had lost that game against Finland,” O’Callahan reflected. While the shock victory over the Soviets grabbed the attention of the world, it wasn’t enough to secure the gold medal for the United States who then had to face Finland for a chance to win the country’s first Olympics gold since 1960. Brooks was the coach who masterminded the team’s epic journey to become Olympic champions. Brooks himself had been the final player cut from that 1960 team, but he would not be dissuaded returning 20 years later to put together the unlikeliest of underdog teams that would go on to shock the world. An intense and demanding motivator of his players, nobody could ever be entirely certain of their place on the team. “He kept everybody guessing and it made us work hard. He held the keys to our kingdom, and he used it against us. And he held it over our heads, and it really did drive us,” O’Callahan says. Having just beaten the Soviets, if the young Americans thought they could take their foot off the gas, they were in for a rude awakening. “He didn’t want us patting ourselves on the back and he came in the locker room the next day and there were people signing autographs. And Herbie came in and saw how loosey-goosey we were, and he tipped the table over and got pretty upset with us and was very adamant about being prepared for the next day,” O’Callahan said. “He put us through a very difficult practice. He did not talk to us. He had a mean face grimace throughout the whole practice, and he pushed us very hard. And at the end, he made some pretty strong statements to us about what would happen if we lost that game the next day.” Losing simply wasn’t an option and yet, once again, the Americans found themselves trailing before scoring three goals in the third period to come from behind to overpower Finland 4-2. The team’s miracle run was now complete. “We were down a goal going into the third and we got together in the locker room and we just kind of stood up and looked at each other and said, ‘This is our game and they’re not taking it away from us.’ We did not need a coach in the locker room to talk to us at that point. We just needed to be together and to just put our heads down and go on the ice,” the defenseman said. “It was the best 20 minutes of hockey we played, and it was a hell of a way to win a gold medal. To go out there and just blow their doors off in 20 minutes. It felt really, really good. And it felt like you could actually breathe.” Tragically, Brooks passed away following a car crash in 2003 at the age of 66 and the now iconic venue in New York where history was made has been renamed the Herb Brooks Arena in his honor. Brooks’ legacy lives on though, but for the players themselves, there remains an indelible bond that can never be pried apart. “There’s just so many memories and not only from the Olympics in 1980, but in the years since then. It’s just been a great run and a great ride for us, the entire team. We’ve maintained our friendships and our closeness has even grown over the years,” O’Callahan said. “And it was really nice, even in the Netflix documentary to hear Rob McClanahan say something like, ‘We loved each other, we still do.’ We’re a family and it really made me feel good,” O’Callahan added. February 22, 1980, is a day forever etched in history. It was the time a Cinderella team of college youngsters gave their country a never-to-be -forgotten moment to cherish. Now exactly 46 years to the very day, a new chapter is open for the current generation of American players to write. “The gold medal belongs to the country, it really does. It belongs to other Americans that have struggled through things, and they look at us and say, if they can do something like that, you know what, maybe we can too,” O’Callahan said. “And if it gives somebody a spark or a lift-up, I mean, that’s what it’s really all about.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/asia/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-verdict-insurrection-intl-hnk\n",
            "Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life in prison Thursday after a court found him guilty of leading an insurrection during his short-lived imposition of martial law, which plunged the country into political chaos and threatened to unravel decades of democracy. The verdict closes a chapter of one of South Korea’s biggest political crises, a saga that has been full of dramatic twists that have tested the country’s democratic guardrails. On December 3, 2024, Yoon, 65,declared martial lawin a late-night televised speech, saying there were “anti-state forces” within opposition parties that were sympathetic to North Korea. Armed soldiers descended on the parliament by helicopter and attempted to storm the chamber where lawmakers were gathered. Shocked and angry citizens, along with lawmakers and parliament staff, rushed to barricade the entrances and fought to block the soldiers from reaching the chamber, in chaotic scenes broadcast live on television. Yoon’s shocking declaration revived dark memories of the country’s authoritarian past, plunged South Korea into a constitutional crisis and was widely condemned as striking at the heart of the nation’s democracy. He reversed course within six hours, after lawmakers forced their way into parliament and voted unanimously to block it. Since the late 1980s, South Korea has transformed into a robust democracy, with regular protests, free speech, fair elections and peaceful transfers of power. The country has also since grown into a major player in the global economy and remains acrucial US ally in Asia. But its domestic political scene remains deeply polarized and fractious, with presidents on both sides of the political divide often facing calls for impeachment, criminal investigations and prosecution. A crowd of Yoon supporters gathered outside the the Seoul Central District Court, watching proceedings on a big screen as it was broadcast live to the nation. Presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon said it was clear that Yoon’s intention in declaring martial law was to paralyze the National Assembly for a significant period of time, considering the words he used in the military decree and the fact he tried to arrest political opponents, including the leader of the opposition Democratic Party and his own ruling party’s leader Han Dong-hoon. The very act of dispatching armed soldiers to the parliament building and transporting them by helicopter constituted acts of insurrection, Ji said. Former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun was also found guilty Thursday of playing a major role in the insurrection and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Kim had previouslytaken responsibilityfor ordering soldiers to enact martial law. Four other former military and police officials received sentences of between 3 and 18 years. In a statement, Yoon’s lawyers criticized what they called procedural violations and said the ruling lacked consistency. “You may be able to deceive the public for a while and draw cheers in the public square, but the truth will one day be revealed in the court of history. We will never yield to distortion and lies, and we will fight to the very end,” the statement said. Song Hwa, 35, who rushed to the National Assembly on December 3 with her husband after hearing Yoon’s declaration, said the verdict was an “extremely important decision” that “will send a powerful message to the public.” Cho Kuk, leader of the liberal-leaning Rebuilding Korea Party, said Yoon “tried to destroy South Korea’s democracy.” “There are many places where democracy is faltering,” he added. “South Korea’s experience shows that the power to protect and recover democracy lies within the people.” Yoon, who can appeal the ruling, had denied the insurrection charge, saying his imposition of martial law was meant to alert the public to paralysing political gridlock caused by the opposition party’s majority in the National Assembly and its impeachment of several senior officials. “The National Assembly brought about the national crisis and there was no other way but to awaken the people,” he said in closing statements, arguing that as president he was exercising his constitutional authority. Yoon, a former prosecutor, called the charge “a delusion and a work of fiction.” He had argued that there was no real intent to arrest lawmakers, no heavy weaponry was deployed, and there were no serious casualties. Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. Prosecutors had sought the death penalty, a largely symbolic move as the country hasn’t executed anyone in decades. “The series of actions destroyed the liberal democratic constitutional order,” special counsel Park Eok-su said in closing arguments. “The shock, fear, anxiety, wounds, and sense of loss suffered by the people are beyond description,” he added. Prosecutors said Yoon had not shown remorse and there remained a risk that his invocation of emergency martial law could be repeated in future. “The gravity of the crime of insurrection threatens the very existence of the community,” prosectors said. Yoon was firstdetained in January2025 after resisting attempts to arrest him in aweeks-long standoffwith authorities at his home in Seoul. He was the first president in South Korean history to be arrested while in office. He was impeached 11 days after declaring martial law and removed from office four months later. Yoon continues to face multiple charges related to his martial law declaration and for other actions during his time as president. Last month, Yoon wassentenced to five years in prisonfor obstructing authorities trying to detain him, abuse of power and fabricating a document. Yoon also faces charges of aiding an enemy state after prosecutors claimed hedeployed secret dronesto provoke a military conflict with North Korea as a ploy for declaring martial law. Other key Yoon allies have already been prosecuted for their roles in the martial law decree. Last month, former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to23 years in prisonbecoming the first Yoon administration official convicted of insurrection charges. And last week, former interior minister Lee Sang-min was sentenced to seven years in prison for participating in a rebellion. Yoon’s wifeKim Keon Heeis also in prison, serving a one-year-and-eight-month sentence for an unrelated charge of bribery. Thursday’s verdict, however, marks the first time in 30 years that South Korea has sentenced a leader for insurrection. In 1996, former PresidentChun Doo-hwan, an army major general, was convicted for seizing power in a 1979 military coup and presiding over the 1980 Gwangju massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators. He was initially sentenced to death, though the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was later pardoned. This is a developing story and has been updated.\n",

            "Rondale Moore, an NFL receiver who had season-ending training camp knee injuries in each of the last two years after a standout college career at Purdue and a promising start with the Arizona Cardinals, was found dead Saturday, authorities said. He was 25. Police said Moore died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. Moore was found dead in the garage of a property in his hometown of New Albany, police chief Todd Bailey said. The death remains under investigation. Floyd County Coroner Matthew Tomlin also confirmed Moore’s death. He said an autopsy would be conducted on Sunday. After being traded to the Atlanta Falcons in 2024, Moore dislocated his right knee during training camp and never played for them. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2025, but he blew out his left knee while returning a punt in their first exhibition game and spent another full season on injured reserve. Moore was so distraught after immediately realizing the seriousness of that injury that he slammed his hand down on a cart so hard the sound was audible throughout the stadium. The Vikings said they had spoken with Moore’s family to offer condolences and support. “I am devastated by the news of Rondale’s death. While Rondale had been a member of the Vikings for a short time, he was someone we came to know well and care about deeply,” coach Kevin O’Connell said in a statement distributed by the team. “He was a humble, soft-spoken, and respectful young man who was proud of his Indiana roots. As a player, he was disciplined, dedicated and resilient despite facing adversity multiple times as injuries sidelined him throughout his career. We are all heartbroken by the fact he won’t continue to live out his NFL dream and we won’t all have a chance to watch him flourish.” In a statement, the Cardinals said they were “devastated and heartbroken.” “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, teammates, and everyone who loved him and had the privilege of knowing such a special person,” the team said ina social media post. Moore grew up in New Albany, just across the Indiana border from Louisville, Kentucky, and was a first team All-American as a freshman at Purdue in 2018. “Rondale Moore was a complete joy to coach. The ultimate competitor who wouldn’t back down from any challenge. Rondale had a work ethic unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation. We all loved Rondale; we loved his smile and his competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact,” Louisville coach Jeff Brohm saidon social media. Brohm was the coach at Purdue when Moore played there. Drafted in the second round by the Cardinals in 2021, Moore had 1,201 receiving yards and three touchdowns plus 249 rushing yards and one score over three seasons. He served as their primary returner for kickoffs and punts as a rookie before injuries pushed him away from that role. “Can’t even begin to fathom or process this,” former Cardinals teammate J.J. Watt said onsocial media. “There’s just no way. Way too soon. Way too special. So much left to give. Rest in peace Rondale.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story corrected a misidentified photo.

            "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Sunday he would ⁠summon the US ambassador to France,Charles Kushner,over comments made about the death of aFrench far-right activistearlier this month, which he labeled as “interference.” Quentin Deranque, 23, died two days after suffering severe head injuries in a brawl in the city of Lyon on February 12, drawing criticism from the Trump administration which described the death as the result of left-wing violence. “We are summoning the US ambassador to France because the embassy issued a commentary on this event which concerns the national community. We reject any interference in this event,” Barrot said in an interview with radio station France Inter. On Friday, the US embassy in France shared an X post from the US State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau which said reports that Deranque “was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.” “Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety,” the X post said. The fatal brawl was caught on video, which showed several masked people kicking and punching a man on the ground, causing widespread shock and anger in France. Authorities have charged two people with murder in connection with Deranque’s death, and altogether 11 have been arrested. The incident has also sparked a diplomatic spat between France and Italy, after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Deranque’s death was caused “by groups linked to left-wing extremism” and condemned “a climate of ideological hatred sweeping several nations.” This is not the first time that Kushner, father of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been summoned amid criticism from the French authorities. In August 2025, the Foreign Ministrysummoned Kushnerafter he accused the French government of a “lack of sufficient action” in confronting antisemitism.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/middleeast/huckabee-israel-us-land-intl\n",
            "The US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has said it would be “fine” if Israel took control of a vast swathe of the Middle East, drawing a swift rebuke from regional and other majority-Muslim states. Suggesting even nominal support for Israeli sovereignty over much of the Middle East is an unprecedented departure from American foreign policy. It also goes well beyond what much of Israel’s far-right is willing to call for publicly. Nearly every Middle Eastern country aside from Israel condemned Huckabee’s comments ina joint statementon Sunday. In an interview with US conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, the ambassador was asked about his understanding of a biblical verse suggesting that land including parts of Egypt, Syria and Iraq had been divinely promised to the Jewish people. Carlson said that according to the Old Testament, the boundaries would be “basically the entire Middle East.” He continued: “Does Israel have the right to that land?” “Not sure we’d go that far,” Huckabee said in reply. “It would be a big piece of land.” Carlson then pressed him: “Does Israel have the right to that land?” “It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee responded, before adding: “I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here today.” Carlson asked: “You think it would be fine if the state of Israel took over all of Jordan?” “They’re not trying to take over Jordan. They’re not trying to take over Syria. They’re not trying to take over Iraq or anywhere else, but they do want to protect their people,” Huckabee responded. “I think you’re missing something because they’re not asking to go back to take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them,” Huckabee added. A statement led by the United Arab Emirates and backed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and others denounced Huckabee’s comments as “dangerous and inflammatory.” Muslim-majority countries outside the region, such as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, also signed on to the denunciation. The Arab and Islamic states statement added that Huckabee’s remarks were a “flagrant violation of international law” that jeopardized US President Donald Trump’s plans for Gaza, some of which wereoutlinedearlier this week at the Board of Peace meeting in Washington. They said “the continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine the prospects for peace and called for an end to these incendiary statements.” The Palestinian foreign ministry said Saturday that Huckabee’s remarks “contradict religious and historical facts, international law, and the position expressed by US President Donald Trump rejecting the annexation of the West Bank.” In November 2024, shortly after Trump announced Huckabee as his pick for ambassador to Israel, Huckabee made clear that he supports Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank. He told Israel’s Army Radio: “I won’t make the policy, I will carry out the policy of the president. But (Trump) has already demonstrated in his first term that there’s never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel.” But last SeptemberTrump said: “I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope, I will not allow it. It’s not going to happen.” CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment on Huckabee’s remarks.\n",

            "In 2020, Mandy Moore and her musician husband Taylor Goldsmith bought their dream home in Altadena, California, as a family of two, hiring a team to begin renovating the romantic Spanish Colonial Revival property and update its 1930s charm. In 2023, as a family of four, with another baby on the way, they moved in and began living their new life in Altadena’s enclave of historic architecture, mountain views and small-town charm. Now, as a family of five, they are rebuilding the home they love after it was nearly irreparably damaged in the devastating Los Angeles wildfires last year. Moorecharts their journeyin the March 2026 issue of Architectural Digest, dedicated to Los Angeles. The long process process is still ongoing. Their main house has been completed once again, while Goldsmith’s backyard music studio and an additional guesthouse are still under construction. (Goldsmith is the frontman of the LA folk rock band Dawes). Many of the rooms are decorated with a blend of earthy tones and decor with 1970s flare, such as curvilinear furniture, olive green accents and checkerboard rug in their living room, while their children’s rooms provide a sense of gentle escapism, like their sons’ dreamy sky-blue room with built-in bunk beds. “We wanted the house to age gracefully with the family,” Moore told AD. “That had a lot to do with the colors we chose — softer, richer, more playful.” Their home is the joint effort of architect Emily Farnham, interior designer Sarah Sherman Samuel, and the landscape design firm Terremoto. “Mandy wanted color and pattern and soft edges. Her taste is sophisticated but playful. They’re both so creative. I like to say it’s a very grown-up house but with a little sparkle,” Samuel told the magazine. “They let us run, creatively.” Moore recalled to AD the January night she and Goldsmith had to evacuate — as the Eaton fire neared their neighborhood, they drove their three children, three cats and dog through the wildfire-stricken area to a friend’s house. They initially believed their home had burned down, but the structure remained intact. They lost most of their belongings due to smoke damage, however, and Goldsmith’s entire music studio — including his collection of vintage instruments — were gone. They were lucky to be spared the worst, and Moore describes the shock of seeing their community for the first time in the wake of the fires. “It was gutting to be up here before the lots were cleared and you saw the degree of the loss,” Moore said. “I wondered how we were ever going to go back. But I think because there are pockets that are untouched, and so much rebuilding is happening in patches around town, it’s clear that people still want to be here.” Moore and Goldsmith began rebuilding with their collaborators about four months after the fires. Farnham told AD that “everyone was in shock for a while,” and that she knew they would call when they were ready. It was impossible to recreate the exact same home piece by piece, but with everything in the home catalogued by Samuel, they got close. “We found some new fabrics and rugs to change that up, and similar replacements for vintage pieces that we lost,” she explained. “But everything else remained the same.” As Moore and Goldsmith continue work on their property, they’ve also seen their neighbors return and make progress, too. Moore says there’s an “undefeatable spirit” across the wider city. “People love to dog LA for every reason, and some of it is warranted. But when push comes to shove, people show up for their neighbors,” she said. “I don’t think that was ever more evident than during the fires.” With the release of the latest edition of the magazine, AD’s editor in chief Amy Astley unveiled the launch of a new fundraising initiative, Design Making a Difference, partnering with Habitat for Humanity and the Foothill Catalog Foundation, to help rebuild homes lost in the fires. The issue also features a guide to the city with recommendations from famous Angelinos including Kristen Stewart — the issue’s cover star — Lisa Kudrow and Noah Wyle. “It’s a personal tour with a lot of heart,” wrote Astley in her editor’s note.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/americas/peru-president-jose-jeri-ousted-intl-latam\n",
            "Peru’s president has been ousted after being censured by Congress, marking the country’s eighth change of leader in nearly a decade ofpolitical instability. Peru’s Congress on Tuesday approved a motion of censure against José Jerí by 75 votes to 24 in a move that came just four months after he took office as interim president and two months before an expected general election. The vote follows accusations that Jerí had held unofficial meetings with Chinese businesspeople, on one occasion while wearing a hood. The political scandal — dubbed in the country as “Chifa-gate” after the term for Peruvian food with Chinese roots – led the Attorney General’s Office to open an investigation against Jerí. “The presiding officers declare the office of President of the Congress of the Republic vacant, and consequently, the office of President of the Republic is vacant,” said Fernando Rospigliosi, acting head of Congress. Legislators on Wednesday picked left-wing lawmaker and former Supreme Court judge José María Balcázar as the interim president to replace Jerí. Jerí, 39, assumed the presidency in October after becoming Speaker of Congress when PresidentDina Boluartewas impeached. Boluarte had led the executive branch since the 2022 impeachment and arrest ofPedro Castillo, who served for a year and a half. Jerí has been accused of misconduct after holding off-the-radar meetings with Zhihua Yang, a Chinese businessman who holds a state-granted concession for one of his companies. Jerí has denied any wrongdoing and said the meetings were “circumstantial.” He has also denied that the businessman had requested any kind of favor or support from him. The first meeting, held at a Chinese restaurant in Lima on December 26, sparked controversy after images showed the president entering the establishment wearing a hood. Jerí had another meeting with Yang on January 6 at a Chinese goods store, where he arrived wearing sunglasses. Neither of these meetings was registered in the presidential records. Last month, the 39-year-old interim president acknowledged the meetings took place and apologized for how they had been conducted. “I admit my mistake and publicly apologize for entering the way I did, hooded, and for how this has given rise to suspicions and doubts about my behavior and generated the creation of all kinds of unreal stories, which have no basis whatsoever,” he said. CNN has reached out to Yang and the presidential office for comment. The scandal has fueled tensions over one of Peru’s biggest challenges: how to balance relations between China, one of its largest trade partners, and the US, which has warned Lima over China’s growing influence. Last week, the US Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said it was “concerned” about reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee one of its largest ports, Chancay, which it said was managed by “predatory” Chinese owners. “We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty,” the bureau said. Jerí is just the latest in a long line of the country’s presidents and former presidents who have found themselves embroiled in scandal, in what some commentators have referred to as the “curse” of the Peruvian presidency. Since the turn of the millennium, no fewer than seven presidents have been brought to trial or faced legal challenges relating to allegations of corruption or human rights abuses. An eighth shot himself dead when police were closing in. Peru’s notorious political instability is often traced back to the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, who was ousted in 2000 after a scandal involving his intelligence chief andconvictedon charges of corruption, embezzlement and human rights violation. Since then, the political careers of most of Fujimori’s successors have also ended in disgrace. Alejandro Toledo, who was elected president after Fujimori, was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for receiving millions in bribes from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. Then came Alan Garcia, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2019 as police closed in as part of an investigation also linked to Odebrecht. Ollanta Humala and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski were also ensnared in the Odebrecht scandal, while Martin Vizcarra was ousted on the grounds of “moral incapacity” – accused of taking bribes during his time as governor. Pedro Castillo was taken into custody for the alleged crime ofrebellionand dismissed by Congress after attempting to dissolve it and set up an emergency government, while Boluarte was impeached due to “permanent moral incapacity” following a series of scandals. All those accused and convicted have rejected the accusations against them. Peruvians are expected to head to the polls on April 12 for a general election. Analysts say Jerí’s removal shows how Peru’s political system allows Congress to remove presidents with relative ease. They point to a clause in the constitution that says Congress can impeach the president if it determines that he or she has “permanent moral incapacity.” Politicians have a tendency to use this as a tool of negotiation and pressure, experts say. This represents a “poisoned apple” for democracy in Peru, according to Francisco Guerrero, senior fellow at the Center for US-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego. “The poisoned apple, the apple that is rotting Peruvian democracy, is based on the idea that the way to get rid of presidents is through impeachment, and the impeachment process is based on a reason that is completely elusive, viscous, fluid, which is this concept of moral incapacity. Who determines the moral incapacity of a president? Well, the legislators themselves. So, we are in a system that I would call one of perverse incentives,” he said. Natally Soriano, a professor at the School of Social Sciences at Monterrey Institute of Technology, expressed a similar view. She said Peru does not currently have strong political parties, but rather fragmented and personality-driven ones, which “makes negotiation and corruption more dynamic under the same constitution.” Guerrero says the country should consider changing its laws on the matter. However, Peruvian lawyer and political analyst Iván Lanegra argues that the main problem lies not in the rules but in the behavior of political organizations and their leaders. “They are actors who have short-term, short-range interests, and therefore the agreements they reach are very precarious, and that makes it difficult for presidents in general to have the possibility of remaining stable in office,” he said. Either way, most analysts agree that whoever wins the upcoming election will face the same risk of political instability. Without broad public support and with more than 30 parties in the race, the next leader will likely lack political power in Congress and will have to negotiate, with all the risks that entails.

            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/tech/apple-west-virginia-lawsuit-icloud\n",
            "The West Virginia attorney general’s office sued Apple on Thursday, claiming the tech giant allowed child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) to be stored and distributed on its iCloud service. The lawsuit claims that Apple prioritized user privacy over child safety for years. The company has tight control over its hardware, software and cloud infrastructure, meaning it cannot claim to be unaware of the issue, the attorney general’s office argued. Apple has for years facedcompeting criticismsthat it should do more to prevent CSAM from being stored and shared on its services, but also that it should protect the privacy of its users’ personal photos and documents. The lawsuit says US-based tech companies arefederally requiredto report this detected content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. While Google filed 1.47 million reports in 2023, Apple allegedly filed only 267. “These images are a permanent record of a child’s trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed,” West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey said in a news release. “This conduct is despicable, and Apple’s inaction is inexcusable.” “At Apple, protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do. We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids,” an Apple spokesperson said in a comment to CNN. Apple also pointed to a feature the company offers called Communication Safety that warns children and blurs the image when nudity is detected while receiving or attempting to send content and displays a warning. It works in apps like Messages and FaceTime, as well as over AirDrop and in the iPhone’s Contact Posters feature and the Photos app image selection tool. The spokesperson added that Apple’s parental controls and features “are designed with the safety, security, and privacy of our users at their core.” McCuskey said during a news conference on Thursday that large companies with vast resources like Apple have a responsibility to address safety issues like these. “There is a social construct that dictates that you also have to be part of solving these large-scale problems, and one of those problems is the proliferation and exploitation of children in this country,” he said. The suit alleges that Apple’s iCloud storage system “reduces friction” for users to repeatedly access and distribute CSAM because it makes it easy to view and search for images and videos across devices. It’s illegal to possess CSAM in the United States and many other countries. Apple has built its brand around privacy guarantees for users. But the lawsuit claims that Apple and its leaders have known about the company’s CSAM issues. The complaint includes a screenshot of what it describes as a 2020 text message conversation about the issue, in which one executive suggested the company’s focus on privacy made it “the greatest platform for distributing child porn.” Other tech companies use tools likeMicrosoft PhotoDNAto detect child exploitation images, the West Virginia attorney general’s office said. Microsoft says it provides this technology for free to qualified organizations, including tech companies. Apple said in 2021 it would use its own model called NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse materials. But itabandonedthe plan following backlash from critics about privacy concerns, deciding instead to focus on the Communication Safety feature. The complaint alleges NeuralHash is a far inferior tool to PhotoDNA. It accuses Apple of negligence for “failing to implement adequate CSAM reporting technologies,” among other claims. The lawsuit comes as there is increased scrutiny on the effects of Big Tech’s impact on children. In 2023, the New Mexico Attorney General’s officeaccused Metaof shutting down accounts it used to investigate alleged child sexual abuse on Facebook and Instagram. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez accused Meta in the lawsuit of creating a “breeding ground” for child predators on those platforms. Meta strongly pushed back on the claims at the time, saying that “we use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators.” More recently, Meta spokesperson Stephanie Otway said in a statement that the New Mexico suit contains “sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments.” West Virginia’s attorney general’s office is seeking statutory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, as well as requirements for Apple to implement effective detection measures.

            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/18/tech/meta-mark-zuckerberg-testifies-social-media-addiction-trial\n",
            "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled Wednesday about whether his company intentionally designed Instagram to be addictive, in front of the young woman accusing Meta and YouTube of hooking her as a child and damaging her mental health. The Meta CEO, testifying before a jury for the first time on years-old claims about social media harming children’s mental health, said he believed he has navigated the safety of young users “in a reasonable way.” But parents who traveled from across the country for the trial, saying their children had been hurt or died because of social media, painted a different picture outside the Los Angeles courtroom, describing a company that they say preyed on and exploited their children in the name of profits. The outcome of this trial, in which a young woman, “Kaley,” accuses Meta and YouTube of designing addictive features to hook her as a small child, could serve as a bellwether for hundreds of other cases. If the companies lose, they could be on the hook for potentially billions in damages and forced to make changes to platforms that have shaped how many people live. Zuckerberg exited from a back door of the courthouse after concluding more than five hours of testimony on Wednesday. Before the trial began, nearly a dozenparents who say their children were harmedgathered hands outside the courthouse before Zuckerberg arrived. Zuckerberg entered through the front door of the Los Angeles Superior courthouse around 8:30 a.m. local time, past a swarm of parents, media and jurors also waiting in line to enter. He did not respond to a question about what his message would be to parents who say their children were harmed by social media. Kaley herself was also in the tightly packed courtroom to hear Zuckerberg’s testimony. Her lawyer, Mark Lanier, previously said she would not be present for much of the trial proceedings because she has social anxiety and difficulty being around crowds, although she is expected to testify later in the trial. At one point in the testimony, Lanier pointed to Zuckerberg’s 2024 congressional testimony that “the existing body of scientific work” has not shown a link between social media and worse mental health outcomes for young people. “We get feedback from a handful of different stakeholders, including people who study wellbeing,” Zuckerberg said. “I took into account all of that info and I think I navigated this in a reasonable way.” Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom during a break, Julianna Arnold said it was “surreal” to see Zuckerberg testify, after years of calling on the company to make greater changes. Arnoldtracesthe death of her 17-year-old daughter Coco to Instagram. “The intention of the company was to prey on teens … exploit them so they can make greater profits,” Arnold said. “That was done intentionally, not by accident.” At the end of his questioning, Lanier brought out a dramatic prop: a poster multiple feet long, held by seven people, with hundreds of photos Kaley had posted to Instagram, as a way of hammering home her compulsive use of the platform. Zuckerberg was pressed on Wednesday about whether children younger than 13 have access to Instagram. The app technically requires users to be 13 to sign up, and Zuckerberg said younger children are “not allowed on Instagram.” But Lanier showed an internal document from 2015 that estimated over 4 million Instagram users were under 13, which it said represented “30% of all 10-12 year olds in the US.” Lanier has said the now-20-year-old plaintiff, Kaley, began using Instagram at age 9. Lanier pointed out that it wasn’t until December 2019 that Instagram began asking new users to input a birthdate when signing up; previously, it just asked them to confirm they were above the age of 13. Instagram in August 2021 started asking existing users to provide a birthdate if they hadn’t done so previously, as part of a safety push for young people. That means Kaley wasn’t asked for her age at all when she joined the platform. Zuckerberg said that in 2019, before the birthdate rule was implemented, there was “some concern around privacy,” but he thinks they eventually landed on the right policy. Lanier has said Kaley sometimes used Instagram for “several hours a day” and was once on the platform for more than 16 hours in a single day, despite her mother’s attempts to curb her use.Kaley claims the app’saddictive features led her to develop anxiety, body dysmorphia and suicidal thoughts and that she experienced bullying and sextortion on Instagram. A Meta spokesperson has said “we strongly disagree” with the allegations in Kaley’s lawsuit and “are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.” The company’s lawyer has argued that it was Kaley’s difficult family life, rather than social media, that caused her mental health challenges. YouTube also denies the lawsuit’s claims. “The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s mental health struggles,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement ahead of Zuckerberg’s testimony. “The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media.” Meta has also pointed to safety features, such as parental oversight tools and “teen accounts,” which implement default privacy settings and content restrictions for users under the age of 18. Lanier asked Zuckerberg whether a company should “prey upon” people who come from difficult backgrounds or are “less fortunate in educational opportunities.” “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people who use its services,” Zuckerberg replied. The exchange got somewhat heated when Lanier questioned whether Zuckerberg and Meta set goals to maximize time spent on the app. The Meta CEO said time-specific goals existed “earlier on in the company” but it then shifted to focus on “utility and value.” “There’s a basic assumption I have that if something is valuable, then people will do it more,” Zuckerberg said on the stand. Lanier showed an internal email from December 2015 in which Zuckerberg referenceda three-year plan for the company, which included “Time - +10% for Instagram.” “We used to give teams goals… we changed that because I don’t think it’s the best way to run the company,” Zuckerberg said in response.He argued that Lanier was mischaracterizing his approach from a decade ago. Zuckerberg reiterated later reiterated that his goal is to build a product that has long-term appeal, not one that gets people hooked in the short-term but makes them feel bad about themselves. In another tense exchange, Lanier grilled Zuckerberg over Instagram’s decision to allow “beauty” filters that manipulate a user’s face to make it appear they’re wearing makeup or have had facial surgery. Meta consulted with 18 experts that found such filters can cause harm, Lanier said. Instagram ultimately decided to allow such filters created by users but not to promote them in the app. “I thought the balance of free expression should allow people to make those filters but that we shouldn’t create those filters ourselves,” Zuckerberg said. He added that “experts in free expression” were also consulted on that decision, but said he didn’t know their names and hadn’t met with them. Kimberly Pallen, a partner at the law firm Withers who specializes in complex civil litigation, told CNN that Zuckerberg needs to show Meta is doing its best. “That’s probably what it’s going to come down to: From the jury’s perspective, are they doing enough? And do they care?” Zuckerberg’s performance on the stand could also play a significant role in how the jury views the case, Pallen said. “It’s going to turn on how these people testify in front of the jury, if the jury likes them, and what the documents show,” she said. Earlier in testimony, Zuckerberg discussed his majority ownership stake in Meta. He argued that the better Meta stock does, the more money gets invested into science andresearch, adding that he haspledgedto give away 99% of his wealth. Lanier asked whether Zuckerberg would also “pledge money for the victims of social media.” “I disagree with the characterization of your question,” Zuckerberg said. –CNN’s Jack Hannah contributed reporting.\n",

            "Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it ⁠described as “ultimatums ⁠and blackmail” by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after they threatened to stop electricity supplies toUkraineunless ⁠Kyiv restarts flows of ​Russian oil. Shipments of Russian oil toHungaryand ⁠Slovakia have been cut off since January 27, when Kyiv says a ​Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in Western Ukraine. Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine within two days unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia ⁠over Ukraine’s territory. Hungary’s Viktor Orban made a similar threat days earlier. The issue has become one of ​the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and NATO but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to ⁠cultivate warm ties withMoscow. Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine. “Ukraine rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “Ultimatums should ⁠be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.” Between them, Hungary and Slovakia have been providing around half ‌of European emergency electricity exports to Ukraine, which Kyiv increasingly relies on ​as Russian attacks have damaged its grid. “If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine,” Fico ​said in ⁠a post on X. Kyiv said that such actions were “provocative, irresponsible, ‌and threaten the energy security of the entire region.” Throughout the war that began ⁠with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Tuesday, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted. Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way. In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed ⁠shipments through Ukraine’s oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine’s main ‌Black Sea port to the EU. Since October last year, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking ⁠out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long ​blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/tech/social-media-addiction-trial-tobacco-moment\n",
            "Big Tech may be on the verge of its Big Tobacco moment. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one of the leading architects of the modern online world, testified for the first time before a jury this week over claims that social media harms young people.His testimonycomes more than four years after internal documents leaked bywhistleblower Frances Haugen indicatedthe company knew its platforms could be harmful. Internal documents presented in a Los Angeles courtroom on Wednesday seemed to confirm what many have long believed — that Meta has known that preteens use its apps; that it’s aimed to maximize the time people spend scrolling; andthat it’s disregarded expert advice about how to make its platforms safer — although the company claims the documents are cherrypicked and out of date. There are still weeks to go in the trial, and its outcome is far from certain. But it’s just the start of a wave of litigation inspired by the 1990s tobacco trials that plaintiffs hope could spur widespread industry change. The Big Tobacco litigation resulted in more public warnings and education about tobacco’s harmful effects, as well as decreased usage, said Joseph McNally, former California federal prosecutor and now director of emerging litigation at McNicholas & McNicholas. “I think there’s a lot of parallels in that the outcome (in the social media trials) very much may change behavior in terms of how people approach social media,” he said. The Los Angeles trial centers on allegations made by a 20-year-old woman, Kaley, and her mother that four social media giants intentionally designed addictive platforms that hooked her as a child and led to mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression. Meta and YouTube deny the lawsuit’s claims. Snap and TikTok settled the case before trial, although they remain defendants in many other cases. Instagram chief Adam Mosserisaid in his testimony last weekthat he believes social media use — even 16 hours a day of scrolling by a teen — can be considered “problematic,” but not “clinically addictive.” Meta and other tech firms have argued there’s no conclusive evidence linking social media to addiction or mental health problems. That language sounds familiar to some lawyers who have taken on tobacco companies. John Uustal, who has successfully litigated numerous cases against tobacco companies and other firms on behalf of individuals, said there are “startling” similarities between Meta’s argument and that of tobacco sellers, including “fighting so hard” to say their product isn’t addictive. “Legally, and morally and public relations-wise, once you admit it’s addictive, you’re done,” Uustal said. (Unlike tobacco, though, Meta and other platforms have noted that social media does have benefits for young people, like fostering creativity and community; some healthexperts agree,others have nonethelesscalled fortobacco-style warning labels on social media.) Kaley’s is a “bellwether” trial for more than 1,500 similar civil lawsuits against the tech companies. Its outcome could help determine how those other cases are resolved. Meta is also currently standing trial in New Mexico in a separate case accusing the company of enabling child sexual exploitation on its platforms. A Meta spokesperson said the New Mexico lawsuit contained “sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments.” And later this year, the first of hundreds oflawsuits brought by school districtsagainst the social media companies is also set to go to trial. The tobacco trials — which took place over decades but began to shift in favor of plaintiffs in the ’90s — similarly saw various types of plaintiffs file a wave of lawsuits, contributing to the release of internal documents andtesting new legal theories. Kaley’s case also uses a novel approach. For years, tech companies avoided safety-related litigation by pointing to Section 230, a law that shields them from liability over what their users post. But her lawyers are now attempting to hold them accountable for product design decisions that they say caused harm to young users, regardless of the specific content they were viewing. All four companies have taken steps to improve safety, including by introducing parental controls tools, adding privacy settings for young users, increasing content restrictions and offering options to limit notifications or time spent scrolling. Many families say such features still put too great a burden on parents and teens to ensure a safe online experience and hope the trials could lead to new online safety legislation. In some cases, thecompanies’ internal documents raise questionsabout how effective or widely used those safety features are. Legal experts say lawsuits can sometimes be faster avenues for change, especially given Big Tech, like Big Tobacco before it, spends heavily on lobbying. “I think in America, compared to some other countries, that’s how we make progress,” Uustal said. “You can look at it again and again, in industry after industry where it was lawsuits that raised the cost eventually high enough that it was cheaper to fix the problem.” The jury in Kaley’s case hasn’t yet heard the full arguments from Meta and YouTube’s lawyers, who are expected to take their turn in the coming weeks. Ultimately, whether the jury sides for or against Kaley in her case, the decision could guide the legal strategy and outcomes for both plaintiffs and the companies in other cases. Either way, more bellwether cases are likely to be tried, and different situations and juries could lead to different outcomes. With each plaintiff loss, the value of future cases could decline, McNally said. By contrast, multiple losses for the tech firms could put them on the hook for billions of dollars in damages and force them to make changes to their platforms to avoid further litigation. It’s also possible the jury will find that one company is liable and the other isn’t. The claims regarding Meta and YouTube are somewhat different, as are the companies’ defenses. Kaley’s case could be harder to win because she had a tough childhood. Meta argues that upbringing is responsible for her mental health challenges, not social media. Her lawyers say it only increased the platforms’ responsibility to keep Kaley and young users like her safe. “The evidence will show (Kaley) faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media,” a Meta spokesperson told CNN. They also said the company has had a “longstanding commitment to supporting young people.” Zuckerberg testified that Meta has evolved how it handles issues like age verification, an argument that suggests “the company took these issues seriously,” said Kimberly Pallen, a partner at the law firm Withers who specializes in complex civil litigation, told CNN in an email. And the jury has heard relatively little so far about YouTube, which argues it’s more like an entertainment platform than a social network. Kaley’s lawyers plan to call the platform’s vice president of engineering, Cristos Goodrow, for testimony Monday. YouTube’s lead attorney Luis Lee has said that “the Plaintiff is not addicted to YouTube and never has been … the data proves she spent little more than a minute a day using the very features her lawyers claim are addictive.” “As much as people want to frame this as a watershed moment for social media companies, it remains true thatthisplaintiff must provehercase,” Pallen said.\n",

            "As ambassadorial jobs go,US diplomatscan do worse than being posted to Europe. The residences are huge, and the life is peaceful – at least west of Kyiv. “You’re in friendly territory,” said Daniel Fried, a former US ambassador to Poland. When disputes arise, most can be kept behind closed doors. But recent public spats among three US ambassadors and their respective hosts have given Europe a taste of the Trump administration’s firmer, less hushed approach to diplomacy. To Washington, the dustups are the sort of tough love the continent needs. To Europe, they are needless antagonism which violates “basic diplomatic norms.” This week, Bill White, the US ambassador to Belgium, criticized the country for its approach to Jewish ritual circumcision and accused the country of antisemitism. White slammed Belgium’s handling of a case in Antwerp, where three Jewish men who perform ritual circumcision – known as “mohels” – are under judicial investigation after they allegedly carried out procedures without doctors present. In a long post on X, White demanded that Frank Vandenbroucke, Belgium’s health minister, intervene in the case. “TO BELGIUM, SPECIFICALLY YOU MUST DROP THE RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC ‘PROSECUTION’ NOW OF THE 3 JEWISH RELIGIOUS FIGURES (MOHELS) IN ANTWERP! THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DO FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS,” White wrote. He called Vandenbroucke “very rude” and claimed the minister had refused to shake his hand or be photographed with him. “It was clear thatyou dislike America, the country that fought and where tens of thousands of our nation’s sons died for Belgium’s freedom twice,” White said. Maxime Prévot, Belgium’s foreign minister, hit back, calling White’s suggestion was “false, offensive, and unacceptable.” He clarified that Belgium permits ritual circumcision “when performed by a qualified physician under strict health and safety standards,” and said that White had been summoned for a meeting on Tuesday over his outburst. “An ambassador accredited to Belgium has a responsibility to respect our institutions, our elected representatives, and the independence of our judicial system,” Prévot said. “Personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms.” CNN has asked the US Embassy in Brussels and State Department for comment. The row was reminiscent of an earlier accusation of antisemitism leveled byCharles Kushner, the US ambassador to France, against President Emmanuel Macron. In a letter to the Wall Street Journal, Kushner – the father of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law – accused Macron of failing to tackle a surge of antisemitism. Macron said Kushner’s brusque letter was a “mistake,” and an “unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.” This week’s spat in Belgium came soon after the US ambassador to Poland, Tom Rose, announced on February 5 that the US would cut ties with Włodzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of Poland’s lower parliament, the Sejm. Three days earlier, Czarzasty had said at a press conference that Trump “does not deserve” the Nobel Peace Prize he has long coveted. Rose said Czarzasty’s “outrageous and unprovoked insults” toward Trump had “made himself a serious impediment” to Washington’s “excellent relations” with the Polish government. “We will not permit anyone to harm US-Polish relations, nor disrespect (Trump),” he said. Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who leads a center-left majority in the Sejm, told Rose: “Allies should respect, not lecture, each other. At least this is how we, here in Poland, understand partnership.” Rose replied that he will “always defend my President without hesitation, exception or apology.” Fried, who served as ambassador to Poland from 1997 to 2000, said the incidents marked a departure from how diplomacy is traditionally conducted. A diplomat’s job, he told CNN, “is to advance the president’s agenda.” “But that doesn’t necessarily mean you defend the president from all attacks. You figure out … how to work within the politics of the country you’re in, to advance the president’s agenda. That means sometimes ignoring attacks and focusing on the agenda,” he said. Fried praised Rose’s work so far in Warsaw, but cautioned: “You will seldom win a public fight on somebody else’s ground. … If you go down the road of fighting on somebody else’s turf, you’ll lose.” The Trump administration has, however, seemed to enjoy picking fights on European turf, from Vice President JD Vance’s dressing down of European allies inMunichto Trump’s frequent outburstsonline. Fried, who also served as the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under President George W. Bush, said ambassadors in Europe may be following this more belligerent lead. “They are responding to what they think is expected of them. Unfortunately, that is a reasonable expectation,” he said. “They’re dealing with a very thin-skinned White House. They may think that if they don’t respond forcefully, they can be attacked by somebody else in Trump-world.” But choosing which “attacks” to ignore can reap rewards, he said. He recalled how José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero swept to power in Spain in 2004 after campaigning heavily against the ongoing US invasion of Iraq and accusing Prime Minister José María Aznar of being President Bush’s puppet. After the election, Fried recalled how Bush had called Zapatero to congratulate him on his victory. “He basically said, ‘Hey, it was a campaign – I get it. But even if we disagree, we have to work together on a whole bunch of stuff, and I’m happy to do so.’ Zapatero was stunned. He was overheard saying, ‘What? He reaches out to me after all I said?’” Bush “knew what he was doing,” Fried said. “A whole bunch of problems were avoided because Bush sort of shrugged. He didn’t take this stuff personally. He had his eye on bigger prizes.”\n",

            "President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Trump is “curious” as to why Iran has not yet “capitulated” and agreed ⁠to curb ⁠its nuclear program, as rallies have taken place at universities in the Iranian capital, Tehran, for the second day. “I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated,’ because he understands he ⁠has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t … I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated,’ but why they haven’t capitulated,” Witkoff said in an interview on Fox News. “Why, under this pressure, with the amount of sea power and naval power over there, why haven’t they come ⁠to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place,” Witkoff said in an interview recorded on Thursday. In response, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X Sunday: “Curious to know why we do not capitulate? Because we are IRANIAN.” Meanwhile, Iranian state media reported demonstrations in support of the government andagainst the United States, following anti-regime protests on Saturday. Verified social media video showed scuffles Sunday between pro- and anti-regime groups at Amirkabir University, where some students chanted for the return of the monarchy. The official Fars news agency reported “counter-revolutionary slogans being chanted by some students at Amirkabir University, Sharif University of Technology, and Science and Industry University,” all in Tehran. Hossein Goldansaz, a professor at Tehran university, told the official Mehr news agency that the university was affected by the mourning period for those killed in January’s unrest. “One of the students’ main points is that we are mourning for the people who lost their lives in these events, those who were our friends,” he said. “We will allow them to hold their demonstrations on the university and if someone asks us for permission, we will give them permission, provided they respect the red lines,” Goladansaz said. “Students should be very careful not to lead to violence and I told the students that if this happens, I will not support them in any way,” he added. Students held protests at several Iranian universities at the start of a new semester on Saturday, some clashing with pro-government groups, Reuters reported citing local news agencies and posts on social media. The protests coincided with ceremonies traditionally held after 40 days to mourn those killed by security forces during last month’s anti-government demonstrations. A video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran’s Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “murderous leader,” and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah, to be a new monarch. On Friday, Trump claimed that 32,000 people were killed during last month’s protests, a far higher death toll than has previously been reported. The US has been building up its presence in the Middle East in recent weeks, putting increasing pressure on Iran as Trump weighs apotential strike on the country. The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group is currently headed toward the region to join another carrier strike group, with dozens of combat planes also moved to the region. Iran ⁠and the United States have differing viewsover sanctions reliefin return for an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday. The official said new talks were planned in early March, after two sessions of indirect talks this month involving Witkoff and Araghchi. Araghchi said on Friday that he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days. On Sunday, he said that he may hold further discussions with Witkoff as soon as Thursday, with another meeting in Geneva. A US official also confirmed talks with Iran were planned for Thursday in Geneva. Araghchi told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that there was a good chance for a diplomatic solution on Iran’s nuclear program. He said that he was still working on a proposal, with elements that can accommodate the concerns of both sides. It was quite possible to “prepare a good text,” he said. “We continue negotiations, we are working on the elements of a deal and the draft of a text,” Araghchi said. Iran has repeatedly insisted it has a right to enrich uranium, which the US rejects. Washington has also demanded that Iran relinquish its stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU), which the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated at more than 440 kilograms last year. The ‌Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran could seriously consider a combination of exporting part of ⁠its HEU stockpile, diluting the purity of its most highly enriched uranium and the establishment of a regional enrichment consortium in exchange for the recognition of Iran’s right to “peaceful nuclear enrichment.” “The negotiations continue and the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists,” he said.

            "Slouched in the back of a car, wide-eyed and unnerved,Andrew Mountbatten-Windsormakes his way home from the police station. It’s an image that was splashed across pretty much every UK newspaper on Friday morning, a day after the brother ofKing Charles IIIwas arrested on suspicion ofmisconduct in public office.Within hours of those front pages, it emerged that once the investigation into him is finished, UK lawmakers will consider removing Andrew from the line of royal succession. Police did not say what led to Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, but he spent a decade as a UK trade envoy. British authorities previously said they were reviewing claims that he shared sensitive information with the late convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein during his time as a representative for the British government. Mountbatten-Windsor has not commented on the recent allegations against him, but he has previously denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein. He has also said that he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior the sex offender was accused of. Separately, London’s Metropolitan Police said Friday they had urged Andrew’s serving and former royal protection officers to “consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard” could be relevant to their investigation into Epstein and his associates. After Thursday’s dramatic developments, what could happen next in the saga surrounding the former prince? After spending his 66thbirthday in the custody of Thames Valley Police, Mountbatten-Windsor was released on Thursday evening and returned home 10 hours later to the Sandringham Estate. He was released under investigation – meaning he’s not out on bail and therefore is not subject to any conditions. That’s not to say he couldn’t have further conversations with the authorities. He can be rearrested or asked for follow-up interviews. While he was detained, he would have been questioned and could have put forward “things that he would like the police to look at,” including potential witnesses or explanations, which the police would then have a duty to explore as evidence, British solicitor Chloe Jay told CNN. On Friday morning, detectives were seen arriving at Royal Lodge in Berkshire, west of London, to continue their search of Andrew’s former home. “When you arrest somebody, you are allowed to search the properties they have control of and the properties they own,” former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Dal Babu explained on Thursday. Police will be “looking for electronic devices, any information that’s held on those,” added Babu, who served in the Met for 30 years. This next stage could be a lengthy process as police continue to gather any evidence that might be available. Following the police investigation, it’ll ultimately be up to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide whether they have enough to charge and prosecute him. The CPS has so far not offered “early investigative advice” to Thames Valley Police as part of the force’s misconduct in public office investigation. This means CPS lawyers have not given detectives any formal guidance on how to proceed. There is no time limit for when charges can be brought. British lawmakers will consider introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession, once the police have finished their investigation into him, CNN understands. The new law, if implemented, would prevent Mountbatten-Windsor – who is eighth in line to the throne – from ever becoming King. British defense minister Luke Pollard said Friday the government had “absolutely” been working in conjunction with Buckingham Palace to bring about the move. Pollard added it was the “right thing to do to stop someone potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne.” “It’s right that people know that there are consequences to behavior, and that should apply to everyone, no matter what station in life you’re born into,” he said. While incredibly rare, taking someone out of the line is not entirely unprecedented. A member of the royal family can be removed by legislation put through the UK Parliament. Additionally, consent from each of the other 14 Commonwealth realms – including Australia and Canada – would be required under a convention enshrined within the Statute of Westminster 1931. The precedent the government could follow would be similar to the act that removed the Duke of Windsor (formerly King Edward VIII) from the line of succession following his abdication in 1936. Using that example, the prime minister or a senior government minister would need to propose legislation for debate by lawmakers. Similar to any other piece of legislation, the bill would need to complete 10 stages of scrutiny and debate in both houses of Parliament. Once the bill has cleared all stages, it would then be sent to the monarch for royal assent before being passed on to each Commonwealth realm for approval. Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, told the BBC earlier this week  that Andrew’s position as Counsellor of State should also be removed. “All of these titles and positions need to be addressed, so we are just left with Andrew the citizen, and a citizen that is fully accountable,” she said. Counsellors of State are certain royals who can be called on by the monarch to act on his behalf if the sovereign is temporarily unable to carry out official duties. Two counselors can be appointed through what’s known as a letters patent to help keep the state ticking over. The current cohort of royals who can step in include Queen Camilla, Princes William and Edward, Princesses Anne and Beatrice. Prince Harry and Andrew are also in this pool of family members but given that they are no longer working royals, it is highly unlikely that they would be directed to step up. Removing Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession would solve this dilemma as it would make him ineligible to serve as a counsellor.

            "A potent winter storm will impact the Northeast starting on Sunday, but there are still questions about how big its punch of snow and strong winds will be for some areas. Snow totals and the chances for a more significantbomb cyclonehave been trending up over the last 24 hours, particularly along the coast, as forecast models come into slightly better agreement. As a result, the first winter storm watches — calling for 6 inches or more of snow — have been issued. They span from the mid-Atlantic, including Philadelphia, to New York City and coastal southern New England. Possible blizzard conditions are mentioned in the watch for Long Island, New York. But models still diverge a bit on the storm’s exact track Sunday into Monday, which will determine if this is a blockbuster nor’easter with heavy snow and damaging winds across the region, or just a major storm closer to the coast with moderate snowfall farther inland. A shift of less than 100 miles in the storm’s final track could decide which outcome wins out, and although forecast models have come into better agreement since Thursday, there are still enough differences to create anunusually high amount of uncertaintyfor a storm that’s set to begin as soon as Sunday morning. We’ll be more confident on the storm’s track and impacts by Saturday, but the trend means you should start preparing for a more impactful storm Sunday night through Monday. Here are the scenarios that are in play: The storm tracks far enough offshore to prevent it from being a major event everywhere but some coastal areas. Still, at least moderate snow and gusty winds would impact an area from southern New England into the mid-Atlantic Sunday into Monday. That could include Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. In parts of the mid-Atlantic, the precipitation could start as rain until colder air arrives and changes it over to snow. Snow totals would be about a half-foot or less in most places in this scenario. Those totals would be impactful and are likely to slow down travel, but should be manageable. The exception might be along the immediate coast from New Jersey through Long Island and into southeast New England. These areas have the best shot at significant snow and strong winds that could whip up blizzard conditions, making travel more difficult. Tree branches could be snapped and scattered power outages are possible because of heavy, wet snow and the force of strong winds. At least minor to moderate coastal flooding is possible with the Sunday night high tide from the Jersey Shore up the coast to southeast New England. A powerful storm develops close enough to the Northeast coast to deliver major impacts over a widespread area — including from Washington, DC, to New York and Boston. Snow totals would be much heavier for a larger area in this scenario, easily topping 6 inches, with some possibly seeing a foot or more. Heavy snow and strong winds would make travel very difficult on roads and at airports beginning Sunday morning or afternoon and lasting through Monday. There’s a solid chance for blizzard conditions in coastal areas. The combination of heavy, wet snow and gusty winds might break tree branches and knock out power in spots. This scenario would also produce at least minor to moderate coastal flooding from the Jersey Shore to southeast New England with high tide Sunday night or early Monday morning.\n",

            "At least one person was killed and dozens more wounded in explosions that hit the westernUkrainiancity of Lviv early Sunday, in what authorities have labeled a “terrorist attack.” A 23-year-old policewoman was killed in the attack, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged, the prosecutor’s office said. About two dozen people were wounded, police said. The blasts took place as police responded to an emergency phone call about a break-in at a store near the city center, according to Lviv’s regional prosecutor’s office. The first occurred after police arrived at the scene, it said, and was followed by another after the arrival of a second crew. Homemade explosive devices were used in the attack, which had been planted in rubbish bins, according to the Ukrainian National Police, citing preliminary investigations. Lviv’s regional prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into “a terrorist act that caused serious consequences.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that several people had been detained, including an individual suspected of carrying out the attack. Police said a 33-year-old woman had been detained in the western city of Staryi Sambir, near the border with Poland. They said the woman was suspected of carring out the attack on the instruction of a handler in Russia. Viktoria Shpylka was named by police as the officer who was killed in the attack. “Her colleagues remember her as sensitive, bright and sincere. She knew how to support, listen and find a kind word even on the hardest of days,” police said. Shpylka, 23, had married a patrol officer last year, the statement said. Zelensky said Sunday that Russia had used 50 missiles and nearly 300 drones in a widespread barrage against locations across Ukraine overnight. The strikes targeted the capital Kyiv and six regions, from Sumy in the north to Odessa on the Black Sea. One person was killed in the Kyiv area, Zelensky said, and eight injured. It was the largest number of missiles fired in one night since February 3. CNN reporters in Kyiv said there had been multiple detonations around the capital overnight. Zelensky said the Russian strikes were focusing on the country’s energy infrastructure, as well as railway and water supply networks. “This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones,” Zelensky said. “We need systems that effectively counter ballistic threats,” he added. One Russian missile strike targeted a factory in northern Ukraine owned by US multinational Mondelez that makes snacks and chocolate. “This is not a military target, but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands, employing Ukrainians, contributing to our and American economy,” Foreign Minister Andrii Sybihasaidin a X post. Four Moscow airports briefly restricted flights, Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia said Sunday. The restrictions came as Moscow’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin said the city was targeted by a wave of Ukrainian drones – a claim Kyiv has not publicly commented on.\n",

            "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on Thursday marks an extraordinaryfall from gracefor the former prince – and it all hinges on a notoriously difficult-to-prosecute law that experts have criticized for lacking clarity. Policearrested Mountbatten-Windsoron suspicion of misconduct in public office, which is a common law offen﻿se in England, meaning it was established through prior court decisions rather than legislation. It dates back hundreds of years and carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Later in the day, Andrew was pictured leaving the police station. Thames Valley police said he was “released under investigation.” Police have not said what led them to arrest the former prince on suspicion of misconduct in public office, but he previously spent a decade as UK trade envoy starting in 2001. He stepped down in 2011 after coming under fire over his association with convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein. Under English law, the offense concerns “serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held,” according to the Crown Prosecution Service, the body that prosecutes criminal cases in England and Wales. The prosecution guid﻿ance sets out four elements required to secure a conviction for misconduct in public office: The person accused must be deemed a publicofficer, and there has to be a direct link between the misconduct and abuse of their responsibilities. The offense must also be willfully committed, meaning the official must be found to have deliberately done something wrong “knowing it to be wrong or with reckless indifference.” Finally, it must be committed “without reasonable excuse or justification.” Legal experts say the offense is complicated and murky to prosecute. While Mountbatten-Windsor’s brother King Charles has sovereign immunity, making him exempt from criminal prosecution as well as civil lawsuits, there is nothing to prohibit legal action against the former prince or other members of the royal family. Areportfrom the Law Commission, which advises the UK government on legal reforms, called it “one of the most notoriously difficult offences to define in England and Wales.” The current law is “unsatisfactory, not least because it is punishable with up to a life sentence,” the Law Commission report said in 2020. And in recent years, the definition of the offense has become a moving target. “In the past two decades, a substantial body of case law has refined, and in some cases shifted, the terms of the offence,” the report said. “Increased usage of the offence by police and prosecutors in recent decades has exacerbated the problem.” Part of the issue is that there is no simple definition of a public officerin modern times, according to the prosecution service’s guidance. It can encompass obvious elected officials – ministers, mayors and members of parliament – but also civil servants, prison staff, army officers, police constables and even bishops of the Church of England. The current law has also been used to prosecute secondary parties, such as journalists who allegedly encouraged public office holders to leak confidential information – something that the Law Commission said has generated significant controversy. And following several high-profile cases, “questions have been raised as to how well-equipped the common law offence is to deal with modern forms of misconduct,” the Law Commission added. The seriousness of the offense is also a factor in cases of misconduct in public office, andthere is a “high bar,”according to the Institute for Government, a London-based think tank. “Because of the ambiguities around the definition and scope of MiPO (misconduct in public office) and the difficulty of establishing all elements of the offence, police and prosecutors have tended to rely on other specific statutory offences where available,” Institute for Government experts have written. Due to the lack of clarity, the UK government has introduced a bill –the Public Office (Accountability) Bill– to better define what is illegal for public office holders to do and to enshrine that in legislation. That bill has nearly made it through the House of Commons and will soon get passed to the House of Lords. If that bill becomes law, British prosecutors might decide not to continue pursuing cases opened under the previous common law offense if they would not meet the requirements for the new legislated offense. In short, there are a fair number of open questions in relation to the allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor. “Allegations of this nature are serious and are likely to involve a complex and detailed criminal investigation,” said legal expert Allan Maidment, a criminal law practitioner at MSB Solicitors in Liverpool. “If charges were ultimately brought, proceedings could take a significant period of time to progress through the Crown Court due to the evidential and legal issues often involved.” The former prince has not publicly responded to the latest allegations to emerge after the US Department of Justice﻿ (DOJ) released millions of documents related to Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior that Epstein was accused of. Mountbatten-Windsor is not the only high-profile person in the UK under investigation for alleged misconduct in public office. About two weeks ago, British police searched two properties linked toPeter Mandelson, a veteran Labour party politician who has been accused of passing on market-sensitive information that was of clear financial interest to Epstein in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when he was serving as Britain’s business secretary. Mandelson had already been removed as Britain’s ambassador to the US in September, following revelations regarding his personal relationship with the late sex offender. The US DOJ’s release ofadditional filesin January heaped further scrutiny on his dealings with Epstein, this time in relation to his actions in government. Among the documents is an email exchange from 2009 in which Mandelson appears to discuss Britain’s plans to impose an additional tax on bankers’ bonuses as a punitive, one-off measure following the crash. Mandelson has denied any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. Separate to those investigations, UK police are also“assessing” information about private flightsflown into and out of London’s Stansted Airport following the publication of the millions of US DOJ documents related to Epstein. Stansted is referenced in more than 80 documents in the files released by the DOJ. Stansted Airport said: “All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.” The airport said that these terminals are “entirely independent” and “no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal.” CNN’s Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Christian Edwards and James Frater contributed to this report.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/style/king-charles-london-fashion-week-tolu-coker\n",
            "London Fashion Week was given a royal christening of sorts on Thursday afternoon when King Charles sat front row on a gold cushion at British Nigerian designerTolu Coker’s Fall-Winter 2026 show. Charles, whose brotherAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrestedon suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday morning, appeared calm as he walked into the rising star’s runway show — albeit 25 minutes late. In a statement issued earlier in the day, he said he learned “with the deepest concern” of the arrest of his younger sibling, and stressed that “the law must take its course.” Wearing a gray single-breasted suit paired with a white collared shirt, printed tie and smart dress shoes, Charles sat next to British fashion stalwart Stella McCartney and the British Fashion Council’s CEO Laura Weir, who escorted the monarch into the venue. Attendees, including British rappers Skepta and Lil Simz, were asked to stand on the arrival of the monarch. The show’s set design, featuring a London Underground tube sign, street lamps, tufts of grass and dustbins, was in part an homage to the area Coker grew up in: Mozart Street in Westminster. Or as she affectionately called it, her “block.” “It was looking at my block in the ‘90s, when I was born,” she told CNN backstage. The collection, which included cropped double-breasted jackets, sailor hats and crisp frock coats in pastel hues, was about “improperness,” according to the designer. Pieces were tailored, pleated and structured in the style of pressed school uniforms, but with a twist — a neckline designed to fold over like it was being shrugged off, for example. “It’s like, you get to your block and you lose that bit of properness and it becomes fun and playful,” Coker said. A 2025 semifinalist of the prestigious LVMH Prize and one of the few Black female designers with their own label, Coker’s latest collection, titled “Survivor’s Remorse,” was a look at Britishness through the lens of the African diaspora. “This collection was one about grief, aspiration, assimilation and then coming back to one’s self,” she said. In one outfit, an eye-popping blue and pink tartan mini-skirt set, Coker combined the striking colors of her Yoruba heritage with a reference to “Clueless,” a film from her childhood. The designer told CNN she had to keep her VIP guest a secret. Over the years, there have been a handful of royal appearances at the city’s fashion events, from Catherine, Princess of Wales, who presented the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to designer Patrick McDowell in May 2025, to the late Queen Elizabeth II, who attended Richard Quinn’s show in 2018. Coker, a former beneficiary of the King’s Trust — a mentorship initiative that supports young people looking to start a career in fashion — said seeing him sat in the front row was a “full circle moment.” “It was really special to have him on our block and to experience what that is like,” she said.\n",

            "AsJordan Stolzhung in the pack of speedskaters, the distance between them and two daring breakaway skaters stretching further and further, Stolz found himself sort of fighting with himself. He could sense, without being told, that everyone was waiting for him - the guy with two gold medals and a silver already in his possession in these Games - to start the chase. Except he also knew if he went too early, he’d be gassed with no shot at finishing. And so he waited, too.Too long in the end. The mass sprint is as much about strategy as it is in skating and Jorrit Bergsma of the Netherlands and Viktor Hald Thorup of Denmark essentially out-strategized everyone else. The two broke away from the pack in the second lap of the 16-lap race, and when no one else decided to give chase, eventually coasted to gold and silver respectively. Stolz, left to fight for bronze, got passed in the final meters, finishing fourth by .09 to Andrea Giovannini of Italy. “It was kind of depressing actually,’’ Stolz said of the groupthink race strategy that didn’t pay off. “It was like everybody was settling for third place. I would have liked it if more people would have tried to chase back, but if I would have done it, like I can’t pull six laps in that amount of distance and still be able to try and sprint in the final lap.’’ It was a fascinating race to watch live, kind of like a horse race and bike race packed into one. Bergsma and Thorup acted like the pace horses, sprinting out from the gate. Ordinarily, though, pace horses get swallowed up, too gassed to finish. Instead, the daring duo stretched their lead lap after lap as the group mentality in the peloton took over, everyone waiting for someone to make a move and then no one making a move. It was not like a bunch of rookies were in there, either. Among those sandwiched far back from the leaders was Bart Swings, a silver medalist in the first Olympic mass sprint in 2018 and a gold medalist in Beijing. “We probably could have made that all back if we would have all attacked,’’ Stolz said. “But they were more expecting me to do it, and it’s give-and-take. If I do that, I’m not going to have a chance at medaling.’’ The distance grew so great that the front two nearly lapped the peloton. By the start of the 13th lap, the leaders were ahead by 21 seconds, an insurmountable distance to cover. For Stolz, it was a frustrating finish to an otherwise great Olympics, but mass start is not necessarily his thing. Before this season, in fact, he hadn’t raced in the event since World Juniors, and though he geared up well enough to win a World Cup event this year, it is far from his comfort zone. He leaves Italy more than pleased with his Olympic effort but understandably also ruing what could have been. “You just have to expect the unexpected,’’ he said. “Everybody kind of switches off when the Olympics come around and things change. So, there’s planning that I could have done a little bit better but overall, I think it was successful.’’\n",

            "As the United States continues a significantmilitary buildupin the Middle East, Iran has taken steps to signal its readiness for war, including fortifying its nuclear sites and rebuilding missile production facilities. Iranian and USnegotiatorsheld indirect talks in Geneva for three-and-a-half hours on Tuesday, but it ended with no clear resolution. Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said both sides agreed on a set of “guiding principles,” but US Vice President JD Vance said the Iranians had not acknowledged “red lines” set by US President Donald Trump. Despite ongoing talks, the White House has been briefed that the US military could be ready for an attack by the weekend, after a buildup in recent days of air and naval assets in the Middle East, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Amid the threat of war, Iran has spent recent months repairing key missile facilities and heavily damaged air bases while further concealing its nuclear program. It has appointed war veterans to its national security structures, conducted maritime wargames in the Persian Gulf and launched an intense crackdown on domestic dissent. In June last year, Israel launched asurprise attackon Iran that destroyed parts of its nuclear program, severely damaged missile production sites and killed key military commanders. Over the ensuing 12-day conflict, Iran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israeli cities, while the US struck three Iranian nuclear sites – with US President Donald Trump claiming they had been “totally obliterated.” Western nations have consistently failed to persuade Iran to curb itsmissile program, which Tehran regards as a central pillar of its military strength and a right to its self-defense. Despite suffering heavy losses in the war with Israel, satellite imagery analysis reveals that Iran has rebuilt damaged missile facilities. Satellite imagery of the Imam Ali Missile Base in Khorramabad, captured on January 5, shows that of the dozen structures destroyed by Israel, three have been rebuilt, one has been repaired while three others are currently under construction. The facility houses silo launch sites critical for firing ballistic missiles with earthwork and construction around them. Two other military bases have also undergone extensive repairs. At the northwestern Tabriz air base  linked to Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles, taxiways and runways have been restored. In another a missile base in the north of the city, extensive work has been conducted after the war. All the entrances were reopened after being bombed shut, the support area by the entrance was mostly rebuilt and some tunnels are now open, according to a CNN analysis and Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies (CNS). At Hamadan Airbase in western Iran, craters created by bombs on the runway have been filled and aircraft shelters repaired, according to a CNN analysis and Lair. Iran has also swiftly rebuilt its largest and newest solid-propellant missile production facility in Shahrud, a technology that allows for the rapid deployment of longer-range missiles. “I think the most important site is Shahrud. The damage there was repaired very quickly,” Lair said. “There was also a new production line under construction there during the war which was not damaged and is now likely operational, which means counterintuitively solid propellant missile motor production might be greater now than before the war, at least at that site.” Despite expressing flexibility in limiting its nuclear program, Iran is rapidly fortifying several of its nuclear facilities, using concrete and large amounts of soil to bury key sites, according to new satellite imagery and analysis from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS). High-resolution satellite imagery from February 10, 2026, analyzed by ISIS, shows Iran continuing to harden tunnel entrances at the underground complex carved into Pickaxe Mountain near Natanz. Fresh concrete is visible at both the western and eastern entrances, increasing protection that could help shield the facility from potential airstrikes, alongside trucks and other construction equipment at the site. At a nuclear facility known as ‘Taleghan 2’ at the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran, satellite images published this week show that Iran has completed a concrete sarcophagus around the site and is now covering it with soil, according to the Washington-based institute that focuses on nuclear nonproliferation. “The facility may soon become a fully unrecognizable bunker, providing significant protection from aerial strikes,” ISIS president David Albright warned ina post on X. At the 7th of Tir Industrial Complex near Isfahan in central Iran, which is linked to producing centrifuge parts for uranium enrichment, damaged structures have been rebuilt, according to CNN-reviewed image analysis. The complex was sanctioned by the UN in October 2025. “I think Iran is reconstituting its nuclear and missile programs, probably faster than Israel claimed it could during (Operation) Rising Lion,” Jeffrey Lewis, Distinguished Scholar of Global Security at Middlebury College, told CNN referring to the Israeli strikes in June. “The reconstruction of the buildings, as well as some other information, suggests that Iran was either able to replace that equipment or move it to safe places underground before the strikes,” he added. Last year’s conflict with Israel laid bare weaknesses in Iran’s command structures under pressure, with Supreme LeaderAli Khameneireportedly becoming increasingly hard to reach and authority devolving to provincial governors. Tehran has since strengthened the Supreme National Security Council headed by Khamenei confidant Ali Larijani and formed a new authority – the Defense Council – to govern in times of war. War veteran and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Ali Shamkhani, who survived an Israeli attempt on his life during last year’s war, was appointed this month as the secretary of the Defense Council, with the aim of “comprehensively strengthening defense preparations” and developing “mechanisms to counter emerging threats,” an outlet affiliated with Iran’s security apparatus, Nour News, said. Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said Shamkhani’s appointment signals that Iran is preparing for the possibility of a US decapitation strike – potentially targeting the Supreme Leader himself. “It’s becoming a … more immediate question, the issue of post-Khamenei succession, and they are getting prepared for that … whether or not that’s going to be the case, it depends on many factors, like the scale of a potential US attack or a campaign. But this is at least what I can see happening from within the system,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. Israel’s strikes on Iran in June were preceded by a sophisticated infiltration by Israel’s Mossad spy agency, a tactic that heightened the already paranoid state of the Iranian regime. Iran has intensified its crackdown on dissent amid concerns war could trigger regime change. Last month, security forces brutally suppressednationwide protests, killing thousands and arresting many more in the deadliest suppression of demonstrations in the history of the Islamic Republic. The regime accused protesters of being Israeli spies and deployed the brutal local paramilitary Basij force to suppress demonstrations which were sparked by poor economic conditions but transformed into calls for regime change. And the regime’s deepening paranoia has even turned inward. Last week, four prominent reformists who campaigned for President Masoud Pezeshkian were detained by Iranian security forces and accused of incitement against “the internal atmosphere” and working “to destroy national cohesion by … spreading untrue positions against the country,” As Iranian negotiators engaged with the US inGeneva, Iran launched naval drills in the Persian Gulf to demonstrate its disruptive capabilities to Washington’s regional allies. In a first, the IRGC closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz for a few hours as it conducted naval exercises, according to Iranian media. The critical chokepoint is located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman,  through which one-fifth of daily oil global production flow every day. Iranian officials have previously threatened to close the strait in the face of tensions with the West, a scenario that could cause upheaval in the global energy market. Iran’s navy also held a joint exercise with Russia in the Gulf of Oman and northern Indian Ocean, where the two sides carried out a drill to “retake a mock hijacked ship,” according to Iranian state media. This month, the US deployed twoaircraft carriersto the region, and one of them shot down an Iranian drone that as it aggressively approached it in the Arabian Sea. And earlier, two gunboats operated by the IRGC approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesman. Amid the US military buildup and Iran’s wartime preparations, experts say Iranian officials are trying to send a message to the US. “The Iranian tactic is trying to convince the United States that war is going to be costly,” said Vali Nasr, a professor at Johns Hopkins University said. “This is not like June. This is not going to be like Venezuela, that the United States will have to face certain costs and it has to calculate those costs before it actually strikes Iran,” he said.\n",

            "The death of a far-right activist in France after a street brawl earlier this month has deepened political polarization in the country as elections loom – and sparked criticism from the Trump administration. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of rallies planned Saturday by far-right groups in memory of the activist – Quentin Deranque, 23. Deranque died two days after suffering severe head injuries in the brawl in the city of Lyon on February 12. A former French prime minister compared the death to the killing of the USconservative activist, Charlie Kirk. Here’s what we know. The brawl was caught on video, which showed several masked people kicking and punching a man on the ground, causing widespread shock and anger in France. Two people have been charged with murder in connection with Deranque’s death, and altogether 11 have been arrested. Some of those arrested had acknowledged involvement in the brawl but all denied intending to kill Deranque, according to Lyon prosecutor Thierry Dran. One man charged with complicity in the killing has been identified as a parliamentary assistant in the hard-left party France Unbowed (La France Insoumise). He has denied involvement. Deranque was beaten near a Lyon conference center where a senior member of France Unbowed was speaking. The party has 71 deputies in the 577-member National Assembly. His death has sparked several incidents. The Place de la République in Paris was daubed in swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans last Sunday after a neo-Nazi rally, and offices of France Unbowed have been attacked. A far-right rally was taking place in Lyon on Saturday, attended by 2,000 to 3,000 people according to the Interior Ministry. A live television feed showed some of the demonstrators wearing masks. The rally included groups such as Action Française, with which Deranque was linked, and was monitored by a heavy police presence. The political temperature in France has risen ahead of local elections in March and a presidential vote next year. Polls suggest the far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National) could capture the presidency for the first time. “There is no space in France for movements that adopt or legitimize violence,” Macron told reporters during a trip to India earlier this week. In remarks aimed at militant left-wing groups, Macron said: “When people explain that they have set up militias due to self-protection, they are committing a moral offense; everybody has to put their houses in order.” The National Rally, the largest bloc in parliament, has blamed what it called the dehumanizing language of militant leftists for Deranque’s death. But its leaderJordan Bardellacalled on supporters not to attend the Lyon rally on Saturday. French sociologists tracking militant political violence say the vast majority of incidents in recent decades have been caused by far-right and neo-Nazi groups. Of 57 deaths in France linked to violence among political groups between 1986 and 2017, all but five were caused by right-wing extremists, according to sociology professor Isabelle Sommier. “For the past 10 years, political violence has increased significantly, with attacks doubling and the number of clashes multiplying fivefold,” Sommier told French newspaper Le Monde this week. “Six deaths have already been recorded since 2022, all attributed to radical right-wing activists,” she added. The Trump administration has described Deranque’s death as the result of left-wing violence, consistent with its criticism of left-wing groups at home. Last September, Trump signed an order designating the anti-fascism movement Antifa asa domestic terrorist organization, accusing it of organizing political violence with the goal of overthrowing the US government. The State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau said onXFriday that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.” “Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety,” the bureau added. Deranque’s death has also sparked a diplomatic spat between France and Italy, afterItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Melonisaid onXthat Deranque’s death was caused “by groups linked to left-wing extremism” and condemned “a climate of ideological hatred sweeping several nations.” “I’m always struck by how people who are nationalists, who don’t want to be bothered in their own country, are always the first ones to comment on what’s happening in other countries,” Macron responded. France has seen a shifting fragmentation of its politics since Macron was first elected in 2017. There have been five prime ministers in the past two years, with all of them struggling to stitch together a majority in the fractured National Assembly. The killing of Deranque has turned the spotlight on the far-left in France and may transform the political landscape, making it unpalatable for center parties to reach any understandings with the far-left France Unbowed – potentially giving an advantage to the National Rally. “France Unbowed in turmoil, the National Rally smiling?” asked analyst Guillaume Tabard inLe Figarothis week, saying that the taboo conventionally attached to the far-right party had now been transferred to the far-left. “A kind of landslide occurred with the death of Quentin Deranque: Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s (France Unbowed) party became the most criticized, both politically and in the media. This is a boon for Jordan Bardella’s party, which had enjoyed this “privilege” for over half a century,” Tabard wrote. Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin sees a watershed moment for the country. “For France, this is the ‘Charlie Kirk moment’ that Trump’s America experienced a few months ago with the assassination of Charlie Kirk by a murderer claiming to be anti-fascist,” de Villepin wrote onX.\n",

            "As Russian tanks rolled over the border in February 2022, rumors that Volodymyr Zelensky had fled Ukraine were rife. With Kyiv under heavy bombardment and Russia closing in, European leaders feared the worst. Then the Ukrainian leader posted a grainy video of himself standing in the dark in front of the presidency building, flanked by his top advisors, and announced simply: “We are here.” Zelensky’s removal was a key part ofRussia’s plan to take over Ukraine– a project Moscow expected to complete in days. He was to be taken or killed, unless he ran away first. A source close to the president told CNN that Russian agents had rented apartments in the immediate vicinity of the presidential office, with an order to eliminate him. At one point early in the war, a joke went around that Zelensky became a comedian – the career he pursued before entering politics – because he was not afraid of bombing. In those early days, Zelensky’s uncanny capacity for survival and humor encapsulated the defiant mood of the country. The story as told by the Ukrainians, is that when the US offered to evacuate him, Zelenskyshot back: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” As Ukraine prepares to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion on Tuesday, and with no end to the war in sight, Zelensky’s message hasn’t changed. He’s still there, having survived not only around a dozen Russian assassination attempts but also a corruption scandal that last yearbrought down his closest adviser, who stood beside him in that now-famous video, and two of his top government ministers. For this assessment of Zelensky’s position, CNN spoke to some of those closest to the president – including his wife and his speechwriter – as well as diplomats and politicians from Europe and the US who have worked closely with him and his administration. Many attribute his sticking power to his skills as a political operator, which, alongside his inspirational speeches, have earned him comparisons with Winston Churchill. But like the British wartime leader who also led his country’s fight against a bigger, more powerful enemy, Zelensky has made missteps along the way and his future looks increasingly uncertain as the war grinds on. Even among the 60% of Ukrainians who say they trust Zelensky, only about half believe he should run for a second term. Last July, Ukrainians took to the streets in rare wartime protests to push back against the government’s plans to weaken the independence of the country’s anti-corruption watchdogs. Zelensky was forced to make a U-turn and acknowledge public anger. He repeatedly clashed with his former military chief, the hugely popular General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, finally sacking him in 2024 in what some saw as an attempt to neutralize his main political rival. More recently, he’s had to navigate a rocky relationship with a US president who has berated and humiliated him in front of the world. Throughout, Zelensky has shown a feistiness that Bartosz Cichocki, Poland’s ambassador to Kyiv during the Russian invasion, believes likely comes from his childhood in one of the poorest parts of what was then the Soviet Union. “During his childhood, in Soviet Ukraine, you had to prove your strength, particularly if you were little Jewish boy trying to prove to everyone around that you deserve respect, it explains a lot,” Cichocki said. “He does not respect weakness, he can confront superior power, you need that when you have to confront bastards like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (his aide Nikolai) Patrushev and all that gang.” But with the war showing no sign of ending, how long those qualities can keep him in power is an open question. At 48, and almost seven years into his tenure, Zelensky is the youngest person to have led an independent Ukraine. He is also the country’s most unlikely leader. A lawyer by training, he had no political experience before running for president, having spent the first half of his professional career in showbusiness. He made his name in the hit TV show“Servant of the People”in which he starred as an impoverished schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president. When he first announced his candidacy, many thought it was a joke. But they stopped laughing when Zelensky defeated incumbent Petro Poroshenko, winning more than 73% of the vote. Before entering politics, he had built a business empire with revenues in the tens of millions of dollars, something Henry Hale, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University and the co-author of “The Zelensky Effect”, says was perfect preparation for the top job. “I don’t think he came into the job naïve. He understood that if you want to make it in showbusiness in Ukraine, if you want to be on TV, you have no choice but to work with oligarchs, because they control all the TV channels,” Hale told CNN. He’s also a natural in front of the camera. While he does sit down for interviews and hold news conferences, his preferred way of speaking to people is through direct video messages, an idea he came up with himself, according to his speech writer and communication adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn. “He decided on the first day that he must explain to people what’s going on,” he said. “We do fewer of them now, but the president thinks it’s important, as the war is moving on, just to explain what is happening, to show people that he is here and doing something,” Lytvyn told CNN in Kyiv. The videos are highly informal, sometimes recorded on his phone, selfie-style. But they resonate. Soldiers on the frontlines have told CNN of their excitement when their unit gets mentioned. He speaks in Ukrainian – something that did not come to him naturally. Like many from eastern parts of the country, Zelensky grew up speaking Russian. He only perfected his command of the Ukrainian language as an adult, after hiring a tutor. Zelensky’s finest hours as a leader came when his country was going through some of its darkest moments. When he decided to stay in Kyiv as the Russians were closing in, it was a sign for many that he was a leader they could trust. Andrii Sybiha‎, who served as Zelensky’s deputy chief of staff during the invasion and is now Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, was in the room when Zelensky made that decision. “He had a choice. His life and the life of his family, or accepting an ultimatum, this so-called capitulation agreement. He refused and his family stayed Ukraine. I really appreciate his strength and spirit,” Sybiha told CNN. The fact thatZelensky’s wife Olena, along with their children Oleksandra and Kyrylo, also stay put, only underscored that feeling. Olena Zelenska told CNN she felt “acute fear” during those first days. Later, this changed to constant fear which she tries to push away. “Because otherwise it prevents you from living normally. This fear sometimes tries to surface … but I don’t allow myself to dwell on it for long.” Almost overnight, Zelensky’s approval ratings shot up from 37% to 90%. This was a moment when Zelensky’s knack for communication paid off. He may not have known how to be a wartime leader, but he knew how to communicate like one. Against the odds, Ukraine managed to repel the initial Russian attack on Kyiv and, within a few months, took back large swaths of land originally seized by Moscow. But Ukraine’s successes came to a halt after the liberation of Kherson in November 2022. After a widely expected counter-offensive in the summer of 2023 failed to materialize, Zelensky began clashing more openly with Zaluzhnyi, whom he removed from the post in early 2024. More frontline stalemate followed – until Kyiv, under the new leadership ofGeneral Oleksandr Syrskyi, launched a surpriseincursion into Russia’s Kurskregion in August 2024. The move delivered a major boost to Ukraine’s morale and slowed down Russian advances along the eastern front. But that boost also didn’t last long – 2025 was marked mostly by Russia’s slow, grinding offensive along the 1,200-kilometer-long frontline. The stalemate continues and, as the war enters its fourth year, Ukraine continues to struggle along the frontlines. Peace negotiations appear stuck, with Russia sticking to maximalist demands on which Zelensky is not willing to compromise. Zelensky knew from the beginning that Ukraine would not be able to sustain the fight without significant help from its allies, most importantly the United States. His determination to secure the assistance he believes Ukraine deserves has, at times, come across as very forceful. But it often worked. Germany, which was initially very reluctant to get involved in the conflict, refusing to provide Kyiv with weapons, eventually did so and is now one of the country’s biggest backers. Lytvyn, the communications advisor, told CNN that Zelensky decided early on to make appeals for help directly to other nations, rather than just their leaders. “He began to talk directly to the public. So many leaders started to help, not because he asked them, but because he asked their people, and the people then asked them,” he said. Public pressure became even stronger after the initial wave of Ukrainian liberations of towns around Kyiv revealed Russian atrocities – including mass killings of civilians. But the authenticity and strong messaging that worked so well in Ukraine and across Europe did not work with US President Donald Trump. Ukraine, and Zelensky personally, have been a toxic topic for Trump. It was the allegation that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden in 2019 that led to Trump’s first impeachment. After returning to the White House, Trump has adopted a far more hostile position toward Ukraine than his predecessor. He has accused Zelensky of being a dictator and repeatedly suggested Ukraine, not Russia, started the war. Against this background, European diplomats, as well as some US lawmakers, warned Zelensky that a trip to Washington was unwise. But Zelensky did not listen. “He went to the White House with the idea that (the Ukrainians) are in the right and that they are the victim here and that they will show (Trump) this. He did not gauge the situation well, and it ended up costing him,” one European diplomat told CNN. “He is stubborn and convinced he knows the best. Of course, without that, he would not be where he is today. But in some negotiations, this just doesn’t work,” the diplomat added. Thedisastrous meeting, shown live around the world, ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance accusing Zelensky of not wanting peace and not being thankful enough. While many officials watched the meeting with horror, it won Zelensky praise in Ukraine. His approval ratings got a boost and Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s prime minister, told CNN she was proud of Zelensky that day. “He defended the position of the Ukrainian people,” she said. Not everyone was surprised by Vance’s comments. European allies already had plenty of experience of Zelensky’s brusque manner.  “The Ukrainians were always very demanding and very direct, always asking for more, especially in the beginning,” the European diplomat told CNN. In the early days of the full-scale invasion, in calls to other leaders, Zelensky would skip the customary niceties and go straight to a request for more weapons. “They were under attack, they were fighting for their lives, and they were looking for weapons,” the diplomat said. “This was well understood in Europe, where we all knew they were fighting for our security as well. If you come to Kyiv, you’d see there’s no time to say thank you … but this is a lot less clear if you are far away, like in the White House.” Since the disastrous Oval Office meeting, however, Zelensky has figured out a way to communicate with Trump, according to US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a close ally of Zelensky, who spoke to CNN in Kyiv this week. “I think he actually has been extremely adroit and insightful in dealing with this administration,” Blumenthal said. “He has mastered an understanding of how to be resolute and firm, but at the same time, appreciative for what America is doing. And I think he’s very genuine about it.” Four years into the war, Zelensky still enjoys poll ratings that many leaders could only dream of. While they have fluctuated since the start of the war, dropping during Ukraine’s unsuccessful counteroffensives and corruption scandals, they have never fallen below 52%, according to polling data from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). When Zelensky visited Prague last year, every minute of his schedule was meticulously planned. There was no time to spare – until someone let it slip that there was a group of Ukrainian cleaners working in the Czech Parliament. Zelensky decided he simplyhadto meet them. The Czechs rolled out the red carpet for Zelensky, but it was a photo of him being embraced by the grinning cleaning ladies that became the defining picture of the whole visit. “It is very typical. He will always fight with his security to let people approach him. He believes that this is what he needs to do,” said Volodymyr Paniotto, a sociologist and the president of KIIS. But his man-of-the-people image has suffered some serious blows over the past year, and a corruption scandal has proved particularly damaging to a president elected on a promise to clean up politics. Anti-government protests in July last year were followed by criticism from Ukraine’s western allies, including the European Union, which has made it clear to Kyiv that it must implement strong anti-graft measures if it wants to join, forcing Zelensky to reverse his plans. Corruption scandals have brought down several people in Zelensky’s inner circle, including his former business partner Timur Mindich and his long-time right-hand man Andriy Yermak, leading some observers to question whether Zelensky had a tendency to over-rely on tainted allies. For years, Yermak in particular appeared untouchable. But even he could not withstand being implicated in a scandal over alleged kickbacks in the energy sector at a time when Ukrainians were freezing because of constant Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. While Zelensky has never been directly implicated, Cichocki, the former Polish ambassador, told CNN he was not sure the president could weather the Yermak bombshell. “I thought this was the end for him. And after a month, with a new team in place, he is back, like the Phoenix,” he said. The years of pressure and heartbreak have taken a visible toll on Zelensky. His pre-war youthful and cleanshaven face is long gone, overtaken by worry lines and increasingly gray stubble. He drinks a lot of coffee – black, no sugar – to get through the work day, which usually begins between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., when the first battlefield reports start coming in. Zelenska told CNN that looking at her husband, it feels like the war has been going on a lot longer than four years. She said that there has not been a single moment of complete happiness since the war started. That will have to wait until after the conflict is over. Instead, she focuses on brief moments of joy, such as when the family got a new puppy and brought it home for the first time. “You can see that looking at him. But that is not as important as what he is going through on the inside, on an emotional level.” Lytvyn, who spends most days in constant contact with Zelensky, said he has not lost his sense of humor and does – sometimes – find time to relax with a book or a movie, especially on long train journeys. “What I admire about him is that no matter what he went through, he remains a decent guy,” he said. “He treats people better than they treat him.” The comedian-turned-president has survived until now, against long odds. But the picture is perhaps bleaker than ever before. Ukrainians across the country are freezing in the darkness as Russia continues its campaign of strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine’s frontline defenses have held up – but only just. Russia slowly continues grinding forward, albeit at astronomical cost. And while Zelensky has managed to repair his relationship with Trump, he has not swayed him into reinstating US military aid. Instead, Trump continues to press Zelensky into negotiations that look increasingly stacked against Ukraine. Paniotto said that most Ukrainians oppose holding elections – not only during the war, but even during any kind of temporary ceasefire.  “In the eyes of the majority, Zelensky is the leader who should take the country to peace,” Paniotto told CNN. When and how that will happen is unclear. But Sybiha‎ told CNN he has every faith in Zelensky’s ability to get there: “He knows how to roll with the punches.”\n",

            "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of Britain’s King Charles III, was arrested on his 66th birthday following revelations about the former prince’s relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. After an early morning police raid at his home in Sandringham, Mountbatten-Windsor became the first member of the UK royal family to be arrested inmodern history. His arrest – on suspicion of misconduct in public office – prompted Charles to express his “deepest concern,” while stressing that “the law must take its course.” After spending more than 10 hours in a police station in Norfolk, near his new home, Mountbatten-Windsor was released “under investigation” late Thursday evening and picturedleaving a police station. Separately, London’s Metropolitan Police said Friday they had urged Andrew’s serving and former royal protection officers to “consider carefully whether anything they saw or heard” could be relevant to their investigation into Epstein and his associates. The former prince’s arrest marks the latest extraordinary development in theyearslong controversyover his ties to Epstein, which has shredded his reputation and snowballed into the royals’ biggest crisis since the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Here’s what we know. They did not disclose what led to Andrew’s arrest, but previously said they were assessing whether he shared confidential information with Epstein during his decade as a UK trade envoy. The royal, who was then the Duke of York, was forced to step down from his role in 2011 over his friendship with Epstein, who had been convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The former prince has denied all accusations against him and insisted he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior of which Epstein is accused. He has not commented publicly on the allegation of misconduct in public office that emerged after the latest DOJ release. The royal was arrested at his new home on his brother’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England. Mountbatten-Windsor had only moved there earlier this month, after the King evicted him from the royal estate at Windsor in Berkshire, west of London, following an earlier DOJ release of Epstein files. Soon after unmarked police cars and plainclothes officers arrived at Wood Farm, Andrew’s residence at Sandringham, uniformed police officers also raided Royal Lodge at Windsor, which had been his home since 2003. Mountbatten-Windsor was detained by Thames Valley Police, which covers Berkshire, even though the arrest was made in Sandringham, which is covered by the Norfolk Constabulary. The Norfolk force told CNN it was supporting Thames Valley Police’s investigation. Late Thursday, Thames Valley Police said it had concluded its searches in Sandringham, but that its searches at Windsor would likely continue through to Monday. After standing down as trade envoy in 2011, Mountbatten-Windsor faced prolonged scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. In 2019, he agreed to a long, sit-down interview with BBC Newsnight in which he responded to allegations of wrongdoing. Having been pictured with Epstein in New York’s Central Park in 2010, after his conviction, Mountbatten-Windsor explained that he had traveled to New York to end his friendship with the disgraced financier. Asked why that involved his staying at Epstein’s mansion for several days, the former prince said it was “convenient,” and that he thought speaking with Epstein in person was “honorable and right.” Mountbatten-Windsor also said he had “no recollection of ever meeting” Virginia Giuffre, who in 2015 had alleged that she was forced to have sex with the then-prince three times, including when she was 17. He suggested that a photo from 2001 showing himself and Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell’s house may have been faked. GiuffresuedMountbatten-Windsor in a New York court in 2021, accusing him of sexual assault. Despite claiming never to have met her, the royal reportedlypaid millions of dollarsto Giuffre in 2022 to settle the case, without admitting responsibility for any wrongdoing. Following further allegations in Guiffre’s memoir, published posthumously after she died by suicide in April 2025, King Charles stripped his younger brother of his title as prince in October. The scandal swelled again after the DOJ released photos in January that appeared to show Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a woman or girl lying on the floor. Charles said he learned “with the deepest concern” of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest and stressed that “the law must take its course.” The Prince and Princess of Wales supported Charles’ statement, CNN understands. The monarch did, however, use the statement to distance himself from Andrew, taking care not to describe the former prince as his brother and attempting to ringfence the rest of the family. “My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” Charles wrote. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former Republican congresswoman from Georgia, pointed out the relative lack of accountability in the United States for those with ties to Epstein. Democratic Rep.Jake Auchinclossfrom Massachusetts struck a similar note, telling CNN: “Great Britain is holding its powerful and privileged to account. The United States of America should do the same.” President Donald Trump called Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest a “shame,” but avoided mentioning his own connections to Epstein. “I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to Georgia. Trump lamented how Mountbatten-Windsor’s predicament would affect Charles, who is expected to visit the US this year, likely in April. “It’s a very sad thing to see it and to see what’s going on with his brother, (the king is) obviously coming to our country very soon, and he’s a fantastic man, the king,” Trump said. Thefamily of Virginia Giuffreexpressed their “gratitude” to Thames Valley Police. “Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family said in a statement. “He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.” Separately,Spencer T. Kuvin, an attorney for Epstein’s survivors, said Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest may “restore some faith for those who believed justice was unreachable.” Mountbatten-Windsor is the first senior royal to be arrested since King Charles I, the monarch who led the royalists to defeat at the hands of the Parliamentarians in England’s civil wars. Charles was detained in 1647 and tried and executed two years later. Although Princess Anne, Mountbatten-Windsor’s sister, was prosecuted and fined in 2002 after her dog attacked two children, she was not arrested. British lawmakers are now considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession, CNN understands. The new legislation, if implemented, would prevent Mountbatten-Windsor – who is eighth in line to the throne – from ever becoming King. An act of parliament would be needed toremovehim.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/12/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-israel-elections-meeting-intl\n",
            "Only one image was released fromDonald Trumpand Benjamin Netanyahu’smeeting Wednesday:a handshake in the Oval Office, distributed by the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. Beyond that single frame, there were no reporters, no statements, no spontaneous gaggle with shouted questions. The discretion added intrigue to what was already an unusuallyurgent meeting,brought forward by a week at Netanyahu’s request. The US has been continuing to build up its military forces in the Middle East, even as Trump pursues negotiations with Tehran. Trump, who rarely avoids cameras, limited his post-meeting comments to a social media post. Netanyahu’s office issued a brief readout reaffirming “the close coordination and relationship” without offering much detail. Trump’s Truth Social statement indicated his insistence that talks continue, in an apparent contrast to Netanyahu’s long-standing opposition to any nuclear agreement and his desire to discuss plans for another strike on Iran during his trip to Washington. Netanyahu later acknowledged conveying his reservations to Trump. “He wanted to hear my opinion,” Netanyahu said Thursday before departing for Israel. “I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran.” He stressed that any future deal must address not only Iran’s nuclear program but also itsballistic missile programandregional proxy networks, arguing that these issues are vital not only for Israel’s security but for regional stability more broadly. Whether the private setting and lack of cameras allowed both leaders to mask disagreements or rather quietly coordinate their mutual future actions remains unclear. But even without cameras, any meeting in the Oval Office plays into Netanyahu’s immediate political needs: a domestic message, even more so in an election year. He publicly boasts about the number of times he has met with Trump since he returned to office — seven, more than any other world leader. And every presidential encounter guarantees that the story will dominate headlines for days, enabling the prime minister to dodge — even if briefly — mounting political problems at home, which caught up with him upon his return. Elections are mandated for late-October, and Netanyahu has told his associates he aims to serve his full term. But his coalition risks fracturing in a looming crisis over the 2026 state budget, which requires approval by March 31. Failure to pass it would trigger the automatic dissolution of parliament, the Knesset, with elections typically held within 90 days — suggesting a potential June timeline for the vote. The ultra-Orthodox parties, key partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, have tied their support for the budget to preserving their constituents’ long-standing exemption from mandatory military service, and they have pressed for passage of a divisive bill to enshrine it in law. Months of negotiations have failed to produce a compromise acceptable to both the coalition and the High Court, which has ordered enforcement against draft evasion. With no tangible compromise in sight, most political observers believe the clock is already ticking for Netanyahu’s government. Political consultant Nevo Cohen, who previously advised far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir, projects the coalition will fracture even if the budget passes and that an election will be called within weeks. “The Haredim (ultra-Orthodox) need the money, so the budget will probably pass,” Cohen said. “But they won’t get a conscription law, and on that, they’ll break the coalition. I estimate that in about a month and a half, the Knesset will dissolve.” Cohen says a key pillar of Netanyahu’s reelection strategy is centered on his relationship with Trump, presented as proof that he is “in a different league” from competitors. Inside Netanyahu’s Likud party, officials believe the prime minister’s decision on how to time elections is closely tied to his interactions with Trump. “Netanyahu will make his decision (on) how far he will go to save his coalition only when he returns from (visiting) Trump,” a senior Likud source said. Netanyahu has invited Trump to Israel’s Independence Day celebrations in May to receive the prestigious Israel Prize — the first ever awarded to a non-Israeli. Trump has not yet accepted, but if he does, the source predicted that the prime minister “will want to hold elections close to the visit,” using images of the two leaders together in Jerusalem for a reelection campaign crescendo. Ties between the two leaders may be more transactional than they appear, as a veteran Israeli political insider suggests, describing Trump and Netanyahu’s current relationship as “an implicit deal.” Trump openly extends displays of support — meetings in the White House and calls to pardon Netanyahu in his corruption case — while acting independently on US regional policy: advancing the Gaza ceasefire plan, restarting diplomatic contacts with Iran and pushing Israel to calm tensions in Syria. All of these are moves that Netanyahu has historically resisted. “Publicly, Trump offers (Netanyahu) hugs and meetings by demand,” the Israeli insider said. Netanyahu, in return, refrains from criticizing moves that he would be “blasting as contrary to Israel’s interests” if any other US president had made them. With Trump, the source said, “he risks undercutting one of his central electoral assets.” On Thursday, Trump called Israel’s president “disgraceful” for not granting Netanyahu a pardon amid an ongoing corruption trial. Trump has been pressuring President Isaac Herzog for months to pardon Netanyahu, including during a high-profile speech in Israel’s Knesset last year. But his latest attack marked an escalation in the pressure campaign, and it came a day after Trump met Netanyahu at the White House. In response, Herzog’s office stressed in a statement Thursday that he “has not yet made any decision on this matter.” When he does, the statement said, it will be “without any influence from external or internal pressures of any kind.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/20/weather/winter-storm-forecast-models-disagreement\n",
            "What are meteorologists supposed to do when the computer models they rely on disagree sharply with less than 48 hours to go before the start of apotential blockbuster storm? That’s the supremely uncomfortable position that forecasters are in on Friday, as two of the mainstay computer models – the American Global Forecast System (GFS), and the European model, plus others, continued to argue over the intensity and track of a Mid-Atlantic and New England winter storm that starts Sunday. The differences between the two major models, along with other forecast guidance, equates to the difference between a paralyzing blizzard along the I-95 corridor and a largely forgettable bout of light snow. Given the costs of major snowstorms in the megalopolis between Washington, DC, and Boston, an accurate forecast could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more in this situation. Lack of preparation for a big storm could cost even more. In this case, the reasons for the starkly diverging computer model solutions can be traced to subtle shifts in how they each handle pieces of atmospheric energy diving south out of Canada, rippling along the southern jet stream near the Gulf Coast, and a high pressure area, or bulge in the jet stream, over the Rockies. In weather, the subtlest differences in depictions of the same atmospheric features can mean the difference between an all-out blizzard in the densely populated region from DC to Boston, versus a light to moderate snowfall. If all the ingredients come together in the right way, then boom! A major East Coast storm. If just one or two of the features are off in their timing or positioning, then a big storm would be far less likely. For the past few days, the GFS has insisted on a near-record snowstorm for Washington, DC, and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic, with a veritable bomb cyclone tracking north-northeastward close to the coast. The Euro model, on the other hand, has consistently shown a much weaker storm tracking farther away from the coastline, bringing much lighter snow to the big cities. The differences could not be starker and are unlikely to be explained by DOGE-related cuts in staffing at the National Weather Service or the resulting gaps in weather balloon data. After all, the GFS and the Euro rely on the same observations to make their projections, yet they are predicting radically different outcomes. Early on Friday morning, the Euro model was projecting that Washington, DC, would receive about 4 inches of snow from this event, compared to the 18 inches put down by the GFS model. The forecast nightmare is even worse in Philadelphia, where the Euro model shows just 1.7 inches of snowfall, compared to a whopping 29.2 inches from the GFS. And while the advent of AI models is giving forecasters more tools in their toolbox for making accurate predictions, they are not solving this forecasting conundrum. Forecasting is far more complex than simply picking a model and regurgitating what it says verbatim. If that was all that was involved in it, there would be many more forecasters, and many more inaccurate forecasts. To create an accurate forecast, meteorologists must understand why models are showing what they are showing, and they need to use their own expertise, considering far more factors than just these two competing models. Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the NOAA Weather Prediction Center, said experts there are looking at all the data that is possible and then focusing their messaging on the potential impacts of the storm rather than specific snowfall amounts. Many good meteorologists do this, which is why you often see a potential range of snowfall amounts in your forecast, rather than a specific number. The best forecasters will tell you what the uncertainties are, and how confident they are in what they’re predicting. “We look at every model, every ensemble system available to us, and usually the answer is somewhere in between,” Snell said. “We need to use all the guidance available to come up with a good message about the storm. And that’s the main thing, is coming up a good message versus the specific snow amounts.” He said he and his colleagues are trying to avoid getting sucked into the computer model battles and keep the big picture in mind. “Clearly you want certainty; you want all the models to agree, and you can speak with confidence that this is the scenario that’s going to occur,” Snell said. “But whenever there’s differences, especially with this population in play along the northeast, you just have to take into account all the possibilities.” Also factoring into the current situation is the track record of the two main warring models: the Euro and its AI-powered cousin have performed far better this winter than the GFS, leading many to have profound doubts about the American model’s blockbuster scenario. Typically, when the GFS and Euro disagree, forecasters stick with the Euro due to its past performance. But those doubts notwithstanding, no other recent storm better illustrates the model differences that can persist almost through a storm’s start time. In situations like these, meteorologists tend to split the difference between the two model camps and call for a light to moderate snowfall with the potential for much more. But in such situations the public messaging can become garbled, with people taking away huge ranges in snowfall, say from 4 to 18 inches, even though the experts see the high-end amount of 18 inches as a low probability, high impact outcome.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/16/asia/thailand-election-anutin-thaksin-intl-hnk\n",
            "A billionaire former owner of English soccer giants Manchester City who dominated politics in his homeland now watches his dynasty fade from inside prison. Former policemanThaksin Shinawatrareshaped Thailand’s politics. He served twice as the kingdom’s prime minister and commanded such a huge and loyal following that parties associated with him have won almost every election since 2001. Now, Thaksin is behind bars and his political party just had its worst ever performance in general elections earlier this month that saw the conservative order he once challenged returning firmly to power for the first time in a quarter of a century. Analysts say the result could mean more stability for modern day Thailand, which has had three prime ministers in as many years and a 20-year cycle of military coups, violent street protests and paralyzing political instability. Much of that instability was triggered by the battle between Thaksin and his allies, versus Thailand’s conservative establishment, a small but powerful network of military, royalist, and business elites threatened by his populist policies. It’s been a bruising fight for Thaksin, with his opponents unleashing military coups, legal challenges and the courts to undermine and even topple elected governments – including four Shinawatra premiers. “Since the Thaksin challenge burst onto the scene in the early 2000s, the whole Thai political game has been about resisting this juggernaut, and resisting progress and reform of the establishment,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University. Thaksin’s promise to improve the lives of the rural working classes, implement universal healthcare and subsidies for farmers earnt him a millions-strong following, particularly among his home base in the northeast. But his popularity made him a threat to the establishment, who saw him as a corrupt populist. In 2006 he was ousted in a military coup, convicted of graft and went into self-imposed exile for 15 years. His die-hard Red Shirt supporters took to the streets of Bangkok in 2010 in protests that were violently put down. Yet even from abroad, he remained a central force in Thai politics, guiding allied parties that continued to win elections despite repeated dissolutions by the courts. Thaksin’s dramatic return to Thailand from self-imposed exile in 2023 came at a pivotal moment. The establishment had a new threat to contend with: a wildly popularprogressive movementthat was not afraid to break longstanding taboos around talking openly about the royal family or calling for fundamental changes to how Thailand is run. The progressive party Move Forward had won that year’s election by promising those reforms. But the Thaksin-backed Pheu Thai party joined up with its former enemies in the military to form a governing coalition in a shock move that relegated the progressive movement to the opposition. Analysts believe Thaksin made a deal to return and allow his party to take up the reins of government once again. Thaksin has denied there was such a deal. Upon his arrival, Thaksin was sentenced to eight years in prison on earlier corruption convictions, a term swiftly reduced to one year following a royal pardon. He served much of that time in a VIP hospital suite, prompting accusations of preferential treatment. A court later ordered him to serve out his sentence in prison. By then, many supporters had become disillusioned and felt the party had sold out. Reflecting those sentiments, last Sunday, Pheu Thai failed to win any seats in the northern city of Chiang Mai, Thaksin’s birthplace and the Shinawatra heartland. “He used his party as a bargaining chip with the Thailand conservative establishment, and to get himself out of a prison sentence – which is he is now serving,” said Napon Jatusripitak, political scientist and Coordinator of the Thailand Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute. “He treated Pheu Thai as a family vehicle, and… I think people have realized that he was using his party all along as a vehicle for personal interest.” The final nail in the coffin came when Thaksin’s daughter and prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wasremoved from officelast year for a breach of ethics over aleaked phone callwith Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen in which she appeared to criticize her own military in border clashes between their two countries. The recent election has Pheu Thai is now a mid-size party, no longer the mighty political machine it once was. “It’s very clear that these legacies are all gone, that people are no longer willing to support a party based purely on nostalgia,” said Napon. And Thailand heads in a different political direction. “The royalist conservative establishment have a way of seeing off challenges,” said Thitinan. “The Thaksin challenge was about populism and redistribution. The next challenge was not just about income redistribution; it was about structural reforms of institutions that run Thailand.” Anutin Charnvirakul, who is known internationally for hislegalization of cannabiswhile serving as health minister, will lead a new coalition with a mandate, with Pheu Thai as a junior coalition partner. The Bhumjaithai party leader is staunch royalist who is firmly against any amendments to lese majeste, Thailand’s strict royal defamation law. His party successfully capitalized on rising nationalism fueled by a deadly border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia last year, economic woes and uncertainty over Thailand’s trade relationship with the United States, and built up a strong local support base. That progressive movement will remain in the opposition. “Whenever you align yourself with the progressives, you must understand that you are attempting to change an entire society,” said Chalit Ratapana, an IT worker who was active during the 2020 youth led protests. “So, if it doesn’t happen today, it’s not that big of a deal. I’ll just keep supporting them.” The new Anutin-led government may be more stable, but “I don’t think necessarily more democratic,” said Napon. “Those instruments can still be weaponized against the opposition as well.” It appears they already are. A day after the election, the National Anti-Corruption Commission found 44 progressive opposition lawmakers guilty for trying to amend lese majeste. Ten of them were newly elected in Sunday’s ballot, but they face a lifetime ban from politics if the Supreme Court rules against them. Yet few in Thailand’s volatile political arena are ever entirely finished. Thaksin could be eligible for parole in May, his nephew is the party’s prime ministerial candidate. “Thaksin is a newsmaker, a dealmaker, with an ego, and always thinks he’s got another card up his sleeve,” said Thitinan. “The Shinawatra brand will still be around. It just will not be potent and decisive like it used to be.”\n",

            "Did you know there is a special way to wear a black turtleneck that only one chilly blonde in the history of the world knew about? And that no one will ever figure out how to wear a turtleneck that way again? Of course, this isn’t true — anyone with a head can look fabulous in a black turtleneck. But the cult of quiet-luxury propriety that has sprung up around the late Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (also known as CBK) protects the fit of her cords and the length of her sweaters like sacred laws. Although an influential dresser in her lifetime, the publicist and wife of John F. Kennedy Jr has acquired near-mythical fashion icon status in the decades since her death. Her style is treated as neither intuitive nor simplistic, even though friends and fashion designers describe those qualities as essential to her appeal. While she may have thrived at throwing on jeans and button-ups or wearing the plainest Yohji Yamamoto dress to an uptown gala, anyone hoping to emulate her must adhere to a strict code of rules or suffer public shaming. Unsurprisingly, CBK fans were dismayed when photos from producer Ryan Murphy’s drama miniseries “Love Story” — the latest offering from his factory of big, camp recreations of pop cultural traumas, this one focusing on the glitzy tragedy of the two Kennedys, who died in a plane crash in 1999 — appeared online last year.Her hair was the wrong blonde, her Birkin deflated, her coat cheaply fitted. This did not bode well for the show’s pre-Valentine’s Day premiere, and since the first three episodes dropped last Thursday, official reviews of the show have been negative, if perhaps a bit overblown. But the costumes? Not so bad. Pretty great, actually! Zero in on a slip dress that Bessette Kennedy (played with ravishing spunk by Sarah Pidgeon) wears on her first date with America’s Prince and premiere himbo people-pleaser, John F. Kennedy, Jr. (Paul Anthony Kelly, who looks the part, which is most of the job). The slip dress was a Carolyn calling card — the perfect mix of casual and sensual. It makes an impact with very little effort. She looks undone, the opposite of how her mother-in-law Jackie attired herself, with her crisp taste for Gucci and Halston, and yet she admonishes Kennedy for showing up 20 minutes late. Her slip dress and his tardiness show us that the two have a very different idea of what constitutes effort — that’s intelligent costuming. The team behind “Love Story” didn’t get here immediately, and the CBK stans were right to call out those early images. But after the backlash, Murphy’s team regrouped and hired a new costume designer, Rudy Mance, an alumni of other Murphy trifles including “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.” Mance consulted author Sunita Kumar Nair, whose fashion biography of Bessette Kennedy has become an encyclopedia for women who parlay CBK authority into minor internet fame. The duo went to great pains to source pieces from the brands and collections Bessette Kennedy wore, including Prada coats and shoes and her favored Levi denim cut. The work paid off (in the first available episodes, at least). Bessette Kennedy was an exacting dresser insofar as she knew what made her feel comfortable. While many of her formal looks present her as bracingly refined, a shield against the unforgiving paparazzi and gossip columns, the show highlights a slovenly streak that heightened her appeal — the unbrushed hair, the wrinkled clothes pulled from a pile on a chair, the ability to make sweatpants look sophisticated. In the first episode, she commutes to work in a black turtleneck and cropped capris, hemmed just above the ankle to show off the square-toed shoes that Prada, in the early 1990s, had just turned from unflattering to secretly cool. The outfit shows us that Bessette Kennedy (then just Bessette) had the knowledge of fashion’s latest shifts, if not the budget to blow thousands of dollars at Barneys, and the intelligence to show it off without fanfare. In a later episode, she wanders downtown with her maybe-boyfriend, the Calvin Klein underwear model Michael Bergin, wearing a navy sweater and sweatpants. A white shirt with wrinkled collar and cuffs pokes out, suggesting a half-hearted attempt to look a little more put together. These are the narrative details of great costuming; not one-to-one replicas, but looks that capture the spirit, priorities and instincts of the person onscreen. “The Crown” and the marketing frenzy of red carpet dressing have taught us that the only way to conjure a long-gone figure is to copy their look precisely. Technology and photography have trained us to expectexactitude. “Love Story” does something better. Bessette Kennedy gave no interviews, so the clothes are essential to widening our understanding of who she was, and what happened to her throughout her marriage (at least according to this heavily fictionalized account). She had a natural sense of freedom that, under media pressure, dissipated into something cold and hard, as if putting the most effort into the most pared- back clothes could help her survive.\n",

            "Mandy Pruna remembers with a nostalgia-filled grin the influx of American travelers that came to Cuba after then-US President Barack Obama restoreddiplomatic relationswith the island in 2015. Pruna and his bright red 1957 Chevrolet were in constant demand and he says countless visitors including celebrities like Will Smith, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian paid princely sums – at least for Cuba – to go on classic car tours with him. His Chevy was one of three vintage American automobiles that US diplomats selected to be in the background for the flag raising ceremony at the US Embassy in Havana that marked the official restoration of ties between the two countries following decades of bitter animosity. “All sectors of society benefited from that,” Pruna said, referring to the brief improvement in relations. “You saw people painting their houses, opening new businesses. For me it was fantastic. It was the best era for tourism in Cuba.” Now, Cuba may be experiencing the most profound moment of economic uncertainty that the island’s residents have endured in decades if not over their entire lives. Through military action in Venezuela and threats of tariffs on Mexico, the Trump administration hasshut off the flow of oilto Cuba, attempting to strong-arm the communist-run island into making significant political and economic reforms. Cuba does not appear to have any remaining allies willing to supply the hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of fuel needed to power the economy. What oil the island has left is running out. The twin loss of fuel and tourists for people like Pruna has been catastrophic. “I need gas to be able to work, I need tourists to be able to work,” he said. As the crisis drags on,life is slowly grinding to a haltacross this island of nearly 10 million people. Classes have been suspended at many schools and workers furloughed to save energy. Near vacant hotels have been shuttered and flights from Russia and Canada canceled as there is not enough jet fuel on the island for longer international flights. The UK and Canada have warned citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Cuba. Last week, organizers canceled the yearly Habanos cigar festival that brings in millions of dollars of revenue. Sherrit International on Tuesday announced that the company is pausing nickel and cobalt mining operations in Cuba amid the fuel crunch. Many government-run hospitals have cut services and a lack of fuel and working dump trucks has caused trash to pile up across whole neighborhoods. On nearly every street corner, conversations center on when power cuts are taking place and for how long. At night in Havana, the stars are often clearly visible as most of the city is swathed in near total darkness. The Trump administration says the Cuban government needs to finally open the island’s centralized economy before it collapses. “There’s no oil, there’s no money, there’s no anything,” US President Donald Trump told reporters Monday, adding that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading efforts to negotiate with top Cuban officials. Rubio, who is Cuban American and a longtime opponent of the Cuban government, has previously said the only thing he intends to discuss with the island’s communist leadership is when they would relinquish power. “This is a regime that has survived almost entirely on subsidies – first from the Soviet Union, then from (former Venezuelan President) Hugo Chavez,” Rubio said last week during the Munich Security Conference. “For the first time, it has no subsidies coming in from anyone, and the model has been laid bare.” After so many years of living on the precipice of economic collapse, a humanitarian crisis may be coming for Cuba. Already most of the food Cubans consume is imported following decades of their government’s disastrous agricultural policies. That tenuous lifeline is at risk though as anti-Castro Cuban-American politicians have called for a total cut-off of assistance from the US. “This is the moment to stop everything: no more tourism, no more remittances, no more mechanisms that continue to finance and sustain the dictatorship,” said Republican congresswoman from Florida Maria Elvira Salazar, a former journalist at CNN en Español. “It’s devastating to think about a mother’s hunger, about a child who needs immediate help. No one is indifferent to that pain. But that is precisely the brutal dilemma we face as exiles: to resolve the short-term suffering or to free Cuba forever,” Salazar said. Already some of the private sector companies importing food from the US have suspended operations, saying they are no longer able to refrigerate their products during the daily power outages. Faced with the worsening shortages, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has called on the population to “resist creatively” and adopt a war-time mentality. “We will eat what we can produce in each place. Now if there is less fuel then food will not be able to leave from some municipalities to other ones,” Diaz-Canel said during a televised appearance in January. At Havana’s “agro-markets” that sell the small selection of food produced on the island, some people warned of the increasing difficulty in bringing fruits and vegetables to the capital from the countryside where they are grown. “We are paying two, three times as much to restock and keep people happy,” said Anayasi, a food vendor who did not want give her last name for speaking critically of the worsening economic situation. “There’s no food. The impact will be terrible. We won’t have anything.” Classic car driver Mandy Pruna said he is considering trying to emigrate to Spain with his family. After 20 years making a good living ferrying tourists in his Chevy, he no longer sees a future in his homeland. “Everything is uncertain at the moment. There’s no fuel. We don’t know if there will be any and how we will pay for it,” he said. “If I have to pay for gas in dollars how do I recoup that if there’s no tourism?” Earlier that same morning, Pruna said, he had suspended his license to work as a classic car driver.\n",

            "A “campaign of destruction” in October by Sudanese rebels against non-Arab communities in and neara city in Sudan’s western region of Darfurshows “hallmarks of genocide,” UN-backed human rights experts reported Thursday, a dramatic finding in the country’s devastating war. The Rapid Support Forces carried out mass killings and other atrocities in El Fasher after an 18-month siege during which they imposed conditions “calculated to bring about the physical destruction” of non-Arab communities, in particular the Zaghawa and the Fur communities, the independent fact-finding mission on Sudan reported. UN officials say several thousand civilians were killed in the RSF takeover of El Fasher, the Sudanese army’s only remaining stronghold in the Darfur.Only 40% of the city’s 260,000 residents managed to fleethe onslaught alive, thousands of whom were wounded, the officials said. The fate of the rest remains unknown. Sudanplunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions including Darfur. The devastating warhas killed more than 40,000 people, according to UN figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The RSF and their allied Arab militias, known as Janjaweed, overran El Fasher on Oct. 26 and rampaged through the city. The offensive was marked by widespread atrocities that included mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, torture, and abductions for ransom, according to the UN Human Rights Office. They killed more than 6,000 peoplebetween Oct. 25 and Oct. 27 in the city, the office said. Ahead of the attack, the rebels ran riot in the Abu Shouk displacement camp, just outside of the city, and killed at least 300 people in two days, it said. The RSF did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment. The group’s commander, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, has previously acknowledged abuses by his fighters, but disputed the scale of atrocities. An international convention known colloquially as the “Genocide Convention” — adopted in 1948, three years after the end of World War II and the Holocaust — sets out five criteria to assess whether genocide has taken place. They are: killing members of a group; causing its members serious bodily or mental harm; imposing measures aimed to prevent births in the group; deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring about the “physical destruction” of the group; and forcibly transferring its children to another group. The fact-finding team, which doesn’t have final say on the matter, said it found at least three of those five were met in the actions of the RSF. Under the convention, a genocide determination could be made even if only one of the five were met. The RSF acts in El Fasher included killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction in whole or in part — all core elements of the crime of genocide under international law, according to the fact-finding team. The report cited a systematic pattern of ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence and destruction and public statements explicitly calling for the elimination of non-Arab communities. Team chair Mohamed Chande Othman, a former chief justice of Tanzania, said the RSF operations were not “random excesses of war” but pointed to a planned and organized operation that bore the characteristics of genocide. El Fasher’s residents were “physically exhausted, malnourished, and in part unable to flee, leaving them defenseless against the extreme violence that followed,” the team’s report said. “Thousands of persons, particularly the Zaghawa, were killed, raped or disappeared during three days of absolute horror.” The fact-finding mission pointed to mass killings, widespread rape, sexual violence, torture and cruel treatment, arbitrary detention, extortion, and enforced disappearances during RSF’s takeover of El Fasher in late October. The report documented cases of survivors quoting its fighters as saying things like: “Is there anyone Zaghawa among you? If we find Zaghawa, we will kill them all” and “We want to eliminate anything black from Darfur.” The report pointed to “selective targeting” of Zaghawa and Fur women and girls, “while women perceived as Arab were often spared.” The fact-finding team was created in 2023 by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, the UN’s leading human rights body, which has 47 member countries drawn from membership in the world body. The team called for accountability for perpetrators and warned that protection of civilians is needed “more than ever” because the conflict is expanding to other regions in Sudan. Over the course of the conflict, the warring parties were accused of violating international law. But most of the atrocities were blamed on the RSF: The Biden administration, in one of its last decisions, said it committedgenocidein Darfur. The RSF has been supported bythe United Arab Emiratesover the course of the war, according to UN experts and rights groups. The UAE has denied the allegations. The RSF grew out of the Janjaweed militias, who became notorious for atrocities in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign against people identifying as East or Central African in Darfur. That campaign killed some 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.\n",

            "Officials in Brisbane, Australia, have revealed plans for 2032’s Olympic stadium: a $2.3 billion venue inspired by the state’s typical suburban homes, known as “Queenslanders” — residential architecture that may be familiar to fans of Brisbane-based cartoon, “Bluey.” Digital images of the proposed stadium — encircled by a walkable platform evoking the Queenslander’s distinctive wraparound veranda — were unveiled Monday, as the Queensland state governmentannouncedthe winners of an international design competition. Set to host the Olympic and Paralympic athletics, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies, the stadium is due to be built in the 158-acre Victoria Park, just north of central Brisbane. But with authorities previously ruling out a brand-new venue in favor of upgrading an existing one, the plans to construct a 63,000-seat arena in a heritage-listed park have met backlash from conservationists. Local campaigners have also expressed concern about potential damage to a culturally and historically significant site inhabited and used by Australia’s Indigenous communities for thousands of years. Following Monday’s announcement, campaign group Save Victoria Parkdescribedthe renderings as “greenwashed computer imagery.” Its statement added that the proposal will cause “catastrophic loss of heritage parkland.” Although the venue’s exact location within Victoria Park is yet to be finalized, earlystudiesby an an independent panel suggested that the stadium would occupy between 12% and 13% of its land. Areportby sustainable development researcher Dr. Neil Peach, however, claims that as much as two-thirds of the park may be “destroyed,” estimating that more than 1,200 trees will be felled during construction. “There’s a marketing ploy to try and convince people that only a small part of the park will be impacted, and it’ll be covered in mature greenery,” the spokesperson for advocacy group Save Victoria Park, Andrea Lunt, said over the phone, adding: “These images are basically selling a fantasy. And the reality of Victoria Park is much more wonderful. The reality is that we have this beautiful, central park full of history.” At a press conference on Monday, Stephen Conry, chair of the Games Independent Infrastructure and Coordination Authority (GIICA), the organization responsible for Brisbane’s Olympic venues, argued the project would, in fact, “maximize the use of the parkland and of green space.” He added that the winning proposal, by Australian firms Cox Architecture and Hassell, would allow “hundreds of thousands of people” to “enjoy Victoria Park and utilize it.” At the same press conference, Queensland’s deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, was more forthright, dismissing the Save Victora Park group as “loopy” and its members as “a bunch of nimbys who don’t want anything to happen.” He also referenced  the recent history of the site, which housed a golf course for most of the last century, only being converted into a public park in 2021. “They believe this park has been activated for years. It wasn’t. It was a golf course. Before it was a golf course, it was a dump, for goodness sake,” he told reporters. Brisbane was awarded Olympic hosting rights in 2021, more than 11 years before the Games — the longest preparation time ever given to a winning host. Officials originally proposed upgrading the city’s largest cricket stadium, The Gabba, to accommodate the Games, though the project’s price tag was heavily criticized. That plan was effectively scrapped in 2023 after an independent government review recommended a different, and even more expensive, proposal: building a new stadium in Victoria Park, at a cost of 3.4 billion Australian dollars ($2.3 billion). But Queensland’s then-Premier, Steven Miles, rejected the Victoria Park plan. So, too, did the current Premier — and then-opposition leader — David Crisafulli who, during his election campaign, said no new stadium would be built. Crisafulli has since distanced himself from the pledge, backing the plan to build in the park after his new government’s own review also recommended the proposal. In August, an Indigenous non-profit group, Yagara Magandjin Aboriginal Corporation, lodged an application for the park’s permanent legal protection with the Federal Government. In astatementat the time, spokesperson and Yagarabul elder Gaja Kerry Charlton described the land as a “place of great significance and history” where Aboriginal communities gathered for thousands of years before they were ultimately displaced by British colonists, sometimes in violent circumstances. “We are very concerned there are ancient trees, artifacts and very important eco-systems existing there,” he added. “There may be ancestral remains. We stand resolute in our responsibility to protect it.” In a press release, the winning architects said they had hired an Indigenous-owned consultancy, Blaklash, to “guide meaningful and ongoing First Nations engagement throughout the project.” In a video call with CNN, Cox Architecture’s director Richard Coulson said he looked forward to engaging with the park’s traditional owners. “Now that we have been appointed, it gives us that opportunity to have that stakeholder consultation,” he added. Cox Architecture and Hassell have both designed major sporting venues in Australia, previously collaborating on Perth’s Optus Stadium and the redeveloped Adelaide Oval. For Brisbane Stadium, the firms will work alongside Azusa Sekkei, a Japanese architecture practice that has helped deliver over 100 sporting venues, including the Japan National Stadium used at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Hassell’s managing principal, Lucy O’Driscoll, said the architects wanted their design to capture “the climate and culture” of Queensland. This is why they turned to the traditional Queenslander houses — semi-elevated wooden homes like the one occupied by the Heeler Family, in “Bluey,” who enjoy an expansive view of downtown Brisbane — for inspiration. In particular, she looked to their verandas, which she described as being “neither inside nor outside.” “People really enjoy occupying these spaces,” she told CNN over Zoom. “So, we really wanted to interpret this at the stadium … by peeling away the facade, building a lot less and allowing a venue that breathes.” While recognizing the stadium would constitute a “significant change” to the park, Coulson hopes that parts of the complex will be permanently open to the public, encouraging foot traffic around the site. “The park is well loved, but it’s not largely occupied because it’s not as well connected to other parts of the city as it could be,” he said, adding: “I think the stadium is a catalyst to allow more people to engage with the park, facilitating connections to and within the park.” As with all recent Games, legacy planning also looms large. The forthcoming Olympics in Los Angeles will only use existing or temporary stadiums, in the hope of minimizing the environmental impact of new construction. Elsewhere in the world, former main stadiums are often considered “white elephants” that lie unused or, given the construction and upkeep costs, significantly underused. As well as being used for entertainment events, the Brisbane venue will serve as a new home for the city’s Australian rules football team, the Brisbane Lions, as well as two cricket teams. The fact that both these sports use rounded playing fields that are similar in size to an athletics track makes the transition easier, Coulson said. In Brisbane, “we have nothing like those challenges that we’ve seen for London and other Olympics,” he added, referencing the British capital’s need to convert an oval athletics field into a rectangular soccer one, adding: “We can actually quite quickly pivot from the Games mode into the legacy mode.” The Brisbane Stadium is expected to break ground this year, with a target completion date of 2031. Save Victoria Park retains hope that the decision can be reversed, saying that applications for the park’s permanent legal protection are still being evaluated. The group is planning a public protest later this month. “We’re going to continue fighting,” Lunt said, “because we’re really committed to protecting this park as a park, not a sporting entertainment precinct.”\n",

            "It took just 11 days for South Korean lawmakers to impeach former PresidentYoon Suk Yeolafter hedeclared martial lawand threatened to unravel decades of hard-won democracy. Now, 14 months after thatill-fated announcement,which led to lawmakers forcing their way past soldiers and police to enter parliament and security forces deployed to the election commission’s offices, Yoon has been convicted of leading an insurrection and sentenced to life in prison. Yoon’s reckoning is the result of South Korea’s mammoth push to hold a head of state accountable for almost tearing up his nation’s democratic institutions. Though his snap decree only lasted six hours, the crisis threw the country into months of political chaos. Investigators have since alleged the depth of the brazen plot extended tosending secret drone flightsinto North Korea to try to provoke a conflict with arch-rival Kim Jong Un and justify martial law. Indeed, when news of Yoon’s address began pinging across her group chats at about 10:40 p.m. on December 3, 2024, Song Hwa said she prepared for the worst. “At first, I thought there was a war,” Song, 35, who runs an online apparel business, told CNN Wednesday. Her husband Heo Woojin said, “As soon as I saw the news, I just felt this huge, invisible pressure that I had to do something.” Yoon was accusing the country’s main opposition party of sympathizing with Pyongyang and of “anti-state” activities. The military decree meant all political activities and protests were banned, troops could arrest people without a warrant, and news media was muzzled. Those draconian measures were never fully enforced. But for older South Koreans the decree brought back dark memories from years of terror underoppressive military rule. On the night of the decree, the couple, who live in Seoul, hastily fed their cat Mango and jumped in the car with one aim: get to the National Assembly – South Korea’s parliament and seat of democracy in the heart of the capital. “I had screenshotted the constitution,” Song said. Specifically, the part where it says the National Assembly can request the lifting of martial law with a quorum vote. Heo said they took a longer route than normal, thinking the major highways across the Han River that snakes through the capital, or leading to the state broadcaster, would be blocked by security forces. But their path was clear. At about 11:30 p.m. they parked their car near the legislature as helicopters buzzed overhead. “The chopper noise was really loud and it was sleeting. It felt like a scene in a movie,” Heo said. Hundreds of people were already gathered at the front gate of parliament in the freezing December night, they said. Meanwhile, on the steps of the assembly building, protesters and lawmakers were facing off against troops who had blocked the entrance. Lawmakers forced their way inside to reach the inner chamber, where they could vote down the military decree. Outside, one politiciangrabbed a soldier’s riflein what became one of the defining images from that night, saying that she felt like the “last line” of defense preventing security forces from accessing parliament. Others piled up furniture to barricade the doors. At around 1 a.m., 190 lawmakers, including several from Yoon’s own conservative party, voted unanimously to lift martial law. Yoon lifted the decree about three hours later. Song said she believes it was the people of South Korea who stopped martial law that night. “I think it was the citizens… who came together to protect our democracy,” she said. “There’s a quote I really like,” said Heo. “‘Courage isn’t the absence of fear, but acting in spite of it.’ The strength of the citizens who acted even when they were afraid was truly incredible.” Yoon’s extraordinary decree was the first time a South Korean leader had imposed martial law in 44 years, sinceChun Doo-hwanseized power in a military coup, inaugurating an eight-year period of iron-fisted rule. Chun was similarly convicted of insurrection, though he was later pardoned. South Korea has spent the four decades since shaping itself into a robust and scrappy democracy, with a political system that in many ways mirrors that of the United States: a presidential system with a strong executive branch. The presidential residence is even called the Blue House. Certain alleged parallels between Yoon and the current US president have also been noted by South Korean academics and even Yoon’s conservative die-hard supporters, whose American flags and“Stop the steal” signs– inspired by Donald Trump’s MAGA base – remain permanent fixtures at pro-Yoon rallies. “Both have very little regard for the truth. Both have little respect for long-standing customs and traditions that underpin democratic institutions. Both have little time for political cooperation,” said Cho Hee-koung, a law professor at Hongik University in Seoul. “(And) both have touted stolen elections and have spread fake news,” added Cho. A former prosecutor, Yoon was a political newcomer when he took office in 2022, winning the presidential election by a razor-thin margin. He was a conservative firebrand and staunch US ally, tough on China and North Korea. But he faced plummeting approval ratings over economic issues and a series of scandals involving his wife and political appointments that prompted calls for him to resign. Months before the martial law order, his party suffered a bruising defeat in elections and opposition parties took control of the National Assembly. Yoon later claimed electoral fraud, but the allegations were never substantiated. Yoon said martial law was the only way he could break a months-long political stalemate in which the main opposition Democratic Party had used parliament to impeach key cabinet members and hold up legislation. “The National Assembly brought about the national crisis and there was no other way but to awaken the people,” he said in closing statements during his trial, arguing that as president he was exercising his constitutional authority. “At the time, many thought that Yoon had failed in his auto-coup attempt because he was incompetent,” said Cho. “But we are now finding out that this had been in the planning for much longer and in much more detail than we had thought and it was by the skin of the teeth and much luck, bravery of ordinary citizens, civil disobedience by some members of the military that saved us.” Presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon ruled Yoon’s deployment of troops to parliament and attempt to arrest political opponents, including current President Lee Jae Myung, who was then head of the opposition, were acts of insurrection. Yoon has fought every legal action against him and his lack of remorse was part of the prosecution’s push for the death penalty – a largely symbolic move as South Korea hasn’t executed anyone in decades. Throughout proceedings, Yoon refused to answer summonses by investigators and engaged in a weeks-long showdown with authorities trying to detain him at his residence, telling supporters he would “fight to the end.” Though it’s not uncommon for former South Korean presidents to face legal trouble, Yoon’seventual arrestwas the first time such an action has been taken against a sitting leader. Yoon described the insurrection charge as “a delusion and a work of fiction” and a political conspiracy. Following the verdict, his legal team said, “we will never yield to distortion and lies.” Former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun was sentenced to 30 years in prison, and four other leaders in the military and police received sentences of between three and 18 years for aiding the insurrection. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo is already serving a23-year sentence. Yoon has the right to appeal, though he still faces multiple othercriminal trials. “By and large, our democratic institutions have withstood a full-frontal attack,” said Cho. “At the same time, this real-life stress testing has really shown where the weak links are and what needs to be repaired.” Song and Heo say South Korean democracy was ultimately safeguarded by the power of its citizens. “To people who wonder, ‘Does doing this really change anything?’ I want to say that if you fight the world does change,” said Heo.\n",

            "Most days, the country’s top newspapers have a wide range of photos gracing their front pages. But on Friday, every image topping the British front pages was identical: A snap ofAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, slouched in the back of a car, looking shell-shocked on his 66th birthday as he left the police station. On Thursday, Mountbatten-Windsor became the first member of the UK royal family to bearrestedin modern history, spending more than 10 hours in police custody at a station in the small town of Aylsham, England, about an hour away from his new home on the royal Sandringham Estate. “The photo gods were on my side yesterday,” said Phil Noble, a senior photographer at Reuters news agency who captured the incredible image. Noble, based in northern England, drove roughly five hours south to Norfolk on Thursday morning – racing to get there after the news of the arrest broke. Through guesswork and some well-placed sources, his two-person team zeroed in what they thoughtmightbe the correct police station,maybe.There are roughly 20 Thames Valley Police stations where the former prince could have been taken, so they had to wait to see. “This was probably the fourth or fifth police station that Reuters had visited that night,” Noble said. “When I arrived, it didn’t look anything out of the ordinary. There was no cars. There was no increased activity.” “To be honest, just before he arrived, I’d left to go back to the hotel… and my colleague Marissa messaged me and said, ‘Look, two cars have just arrived I think you should come back,’” Nobel said candidly in a video explaining how he got the shot. Then the race really began. The Reuters photographer said he “spun the car around, got back, and within a minute of arriving back, the shutters on the garage at the police station came up and two cars left. And one of them, he (Mountbatten-Windsor) was in.” Stakeout photography has a lot of variables, Noble explained. Part of the job is preparation, skill and experience. It also requires a willingness to stand on the side of a British country road in the dark for hours at a time, without knowing if it will lead to anything noteworthy. “Probably half an hour before I took the photo, I’d done some test shots of other cars leaving the police station, so I had a rough idea of… the camera settings maybe,” explained Noble, who has been working at Reuters for more than 20 years. Before that, he worked in photography at the UK’s Press Association and the Manchester Evening News. “But it’s still, you know, more than luck than judgment when the car comes out. You’ve got to try and guess where he’s sitting, which side of the car is he? Is he in the front? Is he in the back? Will the flash recycle in time?” He took six frames in all, according to Reuters. Two were blank, one was out of focus and two showed police officers. But one captured the extraordinary moment. “For every car shot that you do, the hit rate is really, really low,” he added. “So last night was, it was one of those, kind of, pinch-me moments where you look at the back of the camera, you’re tired, it’s been a long day… you can’t believe that you’ve got him.” Mountbatten-Windsor wasreleased “under investigation”late Thursday evening. Police have not said what led them to arrest the former prince on suspicion of misconduct in public office, but he previously spent a decade as UK trade envoy starting in 2001. He stepped down in 2011 after coming under fire over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The former prince has not publicly responded to the latest allegations to emerge after the US Department of Justice﻿ released millions of documents related to Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior that Epstein was accused of. Asked about the photo, Noble said it’s no work of art, but it’s definitely among the most newsworthy he has ever snapped. “Best photo-photo? It’s probably not. You know, it’s a man shot at night through the back of a windscreen,” Noble said, laughing a bit. “Is that the best photo I’ve ever taken? No. Is it up there with one of the most important? A hundred percent.”\n",

            "Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt tussle in hand-to-hand combat on a rubble-strewn rooftop; Donald Trump takes on kung-fu fighters in a bamboo grove; Kanye West dances through a Chinese imperial palace while singing in Mandarin. Over the past week, a slew of cinematic videos of celebrities and characters in absurd situations have gone viral online, with one commonality –– they were created using a new artificial intelligence tool from Chinese developer ByteDance, sparking anxiety over the fast-evolving capabilities of AI. The new model, named Seedance 2.0, is among the most advanced of its kind and has quickly drawn praise for its ease of use and the realistic nature of the videos it can generate in minutes. But soon after the release, media behemoths Paramount and Disney sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance –– the company most famous for developing the video-sharing app TikTok –– accusing it of infringing upon their intellectual property. Hollywood’s premier trade organization, the Motion Picture Association, and labor union SAG-AFTRA also condemned the company for unauthorized use of US-copyrighted works. ByteDance responded with a statement saying it would implement better safeguards to protect intellectual property. Seedance 2.0 has quickly become the most controversial model in a wave of them released by Chinese technology companies this year, as the competition to dominate the AI industry heats up. China’s government has made advanced tech a key tenet of its national development strategy. In a televised Lunar New Year celebration this week, the country’s latest humanoid robots stole the show by performing martial arts, spin kicks and back flips. Such improvements are often met with unease, particularly in the US, China’s chief technological and political rival, in a spiral of one-upmanship redolent of its 20th-century “Space Race” with the Soviet Union. “There’s a kind of nationalist fervor around who’s going to ‘win’ the space race of AI,” said Ramesh Srinivasan, a professor of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. “That is part of what we are seeing play out again and again and again when it comes to this news as it breaks.” Here’s why the latest technology from ByteDance has rattled the world. The AI video generation model, while still not publicly available to everyone, was hailed by many as the most sophisticated of its kind to date, using images, audio, video and text prompts to quickly churn out short scenes with polished characters and motion editing control at lower cost. “My glass half empty view is that Hollywood is about to be revolutionized/decimated,” writer and producer Rhett Reese, who worked on the Deadpool movie franchise, wrote on X after seeing the video of Cruise and Pitt. One Chinese tech blogger using Seedance 2.0 said it was so advanced that it was able to generate realistic audio of his voice based solely on an image of him, raising fears over deepfakes and privacy. Afterwards, ByteDance rolled back that feature and introduced verification requirements for users who want to create digital avatars with their own images and audio, according to Chinese media. Rogier Creemers, an assistant professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who researches China’s domestic tech policy, said part of the concern stems from the rapid rate at which Chinese companies have released new iterations of AI technology this year. That has also put China on the back foot in assessing the potential negative impacts of each improvement, he said. “The more capable these apps become, automatically, the more potentially harmful they become,” said Creemers. “It’s a little bit like a car. If you build a car that can drive faster, that gets you where you need to be a lot more quickly, but it also means that you can crash faster.” After outcry from Hollywood, ByteDance said in a statement that it respects intellectual property rights and will strengthen safeguards against the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likenesses on its platform, though it did not specify how. User complaints prompted the recent ByteDance rollback and have also forced popular Chinese Instagram-like app RedNote to restrict any AI-made content that has not been properly labeled. And the arrival of Seedance 2.0 coincides with a tightening of regulations for AI content in China. China’s domestic regulation of AI surpasses the efforts of most other countries in the world, in part because of its longstanding censorship apparatus. Last week, the Cyberspace Administration of China said it was cracking down on unlabeled AI-generated content, penalizing more than 13,000 accounts and removing hundreds of thousands of posts. However, the restrictions on AI-generated content on the Chinese internet are often unevenly enforced, Nick Corvino wrote in ChinaTalk, a China-focused newsletter. He attributed the problem in part to difficulties policing content across different apps, as well as incentives for tech companies to encourage user content. “With Chinese social media platforms locked in fierce competition, both with each other and the Western market, none wants to be the strictest enforcer while others let content flow freely,” he said in a post following the launch of Seedance 2.0. According to analysts, China is walking a fine line between encouraging domestic development of AI models and maintaining strict controls on how those models are used. “People in the AI business would always say what the Chinese government is doing is slowing down the development of AI,” said Creemers of Leiden University. “Obviously a content control system like the Chinese that essentially limits what you can produce, that’s never fun.” Pressure to stop using certain images or data, from US media giants or other sources, may also impact efforts to refine AI. Disney accused ByteDance of illegally using its IP to train Seedance 2.0, but recently struck a deal with US company OpenAI to give Sora – OpenAI’s video generation model and Seedance competitor – access to trademarked characters like Mickey and Minnie Mouse. “These agreements have everything to do with what kind of data are they going to get access to that they would not have otherwise, or that their competitors would not have?” said Srinivasan from UCLA. “There’s a high probability that the Sora products could be more refined and more advanced, if the data are better suited for the models to learn from.” At the same time, restrictions on how AI can be used or trained could also spur greater innovation, he said, noting how Chinese company DeepSeek –– blessed with a much smaller budget than the industry leaders –– built a competitive AI-powered chatbot. “When it comes to Chinese breakthroughs in AI, the DeepSeek revelation was so important because they showed that there are other ways of training language models in ways that are more economical,” he said.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-war-intl\n",
            "In the early hours of February 24 2022, standing on the freezing roof of a hotel in Kyiv, the idea that Russia would launch a full-scale assault onUkraine, despite a troop buildup on the border, still seemed almost impossible to imagine. Yes,Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin strongman, had developed a taste for wielding Russia’s hard power. Putin’s wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Syria, as well as military action in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, had delivered him success at a relatively low cost. But invading the second biggest country in Europe, after Russia itself, would be a potentially catastrophic prospect which would, surely, give a cold strategist like Putin pause for thought. Apparently not, I remember thinking, as I grappled with my flak jacket while missiles rained down on the Ukrainian capital. The past four years of conflict have exposed more than one faulty assumption, not least the previously widespread belief even among Kyiv’s allies that Ukraine would be too weak, too disorganized, to resist a full-scale invasion. Likewise, the reputation of invincibility surrounding Russia’s vast military has also been dented. According to research by one think tank, The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), when the Kremlin launched what it dubbed its “Special Military Operation,” it expected its forces to take control of Ukraine within just 10 days. More than 1450 days later, that timeframe looks hopelessly naïve and has proved to have been a fundamental miscalculation that has taken a devastating toll in pain, destruction and bloodshed. The true cost is, of course, carefully suppressed in a Russia where information is under increasingly tight control. Official casualty figures are kept strictly out of the public gaze, although estimates from multiple sources indicate losses that are eye-wateringly high. Latest research from the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), for example, puts the number at nearly 1.2 million Russian dead and injured since the full-scale invasion was launched. That appalling body count – which does not, of course, include the staggering Ukrainian toll, thought to be between 500,000 and 600,000 people – is higher than all casualties suffered by “any major power in any war since World War II”, the CSIS report says. Of that estimate, as many as 325,000 Russians, the report adds, have been killed in the past four years – for some context, that’s triple the combined losses inflicted on US forces in every war Washington has fought since 1945, including on the battlefields of Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. And as the Ukraine conflict enters a fifth year, the military bloodbath – as President Donald Trump frequently points out – is only getting worse, climbing steadily upwards as every month passes. Again, the Kremlin has not confirmed the figures, but Ukrainian officials recently boasted of killing 35,000 Russian troops in December alone. The stated aim of military planners in Kyiv is now to kill Russian soldiers faster than new recruits – who are for the moment mainly volunteers – can be trained and sent into battle. “If we reach 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They view people as a resource and shortages are already evident,” Ukraine’s defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, told journalists at a recent news conference. In more ways than one, this war has mutated into an ugly numbers game. Whenever I visit Moscow, a city so many friends and colleagues have now left, or been excluded from, it’s striking how distant the brutal war in Ukraine seems. On the surface, at least, the glitzy Russian capital, with its shops and cafes and traffic jams, is well-insulated against the horrors of the frontlines, save the occasional interception of Ukrainian drones, about which few Muscovites, frankly, spare a passing thought. Following a brief sanctions shock after the 2022 invasion, Russian military spending surged, and its economy boomed. Fueled by oil and gas exports, Russia defied Western predictions of economic collapse, instead becoming the 9th-biggest economy in the world in 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund, ahead of Canada and Brazil. That’s up from 11th place before the war in Ukraine began. But there are growing signs of creeping financial pain, linked to a distorted war economy. One problem is the increasingly expensive practice of offering large signing bonuses to Russians who agree to join the military, plus even bigger payouts if they are killed in action. In addition, military recruitment and the prioritizing of military industrial production have led to what one Russian pro-Kremlin newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, has called a “severe labor shortage” in other essential industries. “The economy does not have enough machine operators or assembly workers. We need to find 800,000 blue-collar workers from somewhere,” the paper reported. The spiraling cost of foodstuffs has been an increasing focus of consumer pain, with cucumbers becoming the most recent lightning rod for popular discontent. Official statistics show cucumber prices have doubled since December, while some shops are reported to be selling them at an even greater mark-up – wartime prices for a salad staple, as the Russian economy slows. “The prices for cucumbers and tomatoes are outrageous. Once, they said eggs were ‘golden’. Now it’s cucumbers,” a woman who called herself Svetlana posted online in one rare public rebuke of the authorities. Elsewhere, stories of economic gloom – from galloping inflation to restaurant closures and the knock-on impact of severe tax increases – describe the many ways in which the prolonged war in Ukraine is now hitting Russians hard in the pocket at home. Neither has the war been much of a boon for the Kremlin abroad. Stopping a further expansion of NATO was one of the main reasons Russian officials said the invasion in Ukraine was launched in the first place. The fact that Sweden and Finland joined the alliance as a direct result of the full-scale invasion is a clear failure of that aim, Finland’s accession alone more than doubling the land border between Russia and NATO states. What’s more, Western sanctions and political isolation have forced Russia to pivot east, especially to China, on which it is now increasingly reliant for essential trade, from energy exports to imports of cars and electronics, all giving Beijing a whip hand over Moscow. “The relationship is unbalanced because Moscow is more dependent on Beijing than Beijing is on Moscow,” commented a recent report from the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). “Russia has clearly become the junior partner, primarily due to its limited economic alternatives,” the CEPA report added. Moscow has also seemed unable to prevent the erosion of its traditional influence elsewhere. In 2024, the Kremlin was forced to evacuate and grant asylum to its Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, as he was toppled by rebel forces. The new president of Syria, where Russia still has two military bases, has repeatedly called for Assad to be extradited from Moscow. Last summer, Russia stood by powerlessly as US and Israeli war planes struck Iran, another key Russian Kremlin partner in the Middle East,  targeting its nuclear facilities. It was also unable to protect the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, a figure with close Kremlin ties, from being seized in a raid by US troops last month from his bedroom in Caracas. It may be that Russia would never have been able to prevent these events from unfolding, even if it were not already stretched and bogged down in Ukraine. But after four years of grinding war, that has taken a horrific toll on Ukraine, Russia has been left depleted at home and diminished on the international stage. Back on that hotel rooftop in Kyiv in February 2022, I was wrong – along with many others – about the likelihood of Putin ordering a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But we were unfortunately right about the catastrophic consequences of doing so – for Ukrainians, of course, and for Russians too – it was a prediction that has unfortunately proved all too accurate.\n",

            "The leader of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, was killed on Sunday following an operation led by Mexico’s military, the government announced. Oseguera, a former police officer, led the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG, as it became one of the “most powerful and ruthless criminal organizations” inside Mexico, according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Security forces from several federal branches of Mexico’s military carried out the operation in the town of Tapalpa in the western state of Jalisco. CJNG members traded fire with the government forces, resulting in four gang members being killed at the scene, Mexico’s Secretariat of National Defense said. Osegeura and two others were seriously injured and died as they were being transported via aircraft to Mexico City, according to the secretariat. Three Mexican military personnel were also injured in the operation and transferred to a hospital in Mexico City for treatment. The military operation triggered a series of violent events across the state of Jalisco, which is scheduled to host four matches of the 2026 World Cup in June, before spreading to other states such as Michoacán and Guanajuato. Suspected members of organized crime groups set buses on fire, blocked roads in the area, and clashed with authorities, Jalisco Governor Pablo Lemus Navarro reported. During the operation, Lemusurgedresidents to remain in their homes and said that public transportation services in Jalisco would be suspended “until the situation is under control.” The governor stated that the violence has spread to at least five states and urged the public to avoid traveling on highways. The US State Departmentissueda travel advisory urging US citizens to shelter in place in the Mexican states of Jalisco, Tamaulipas, and Michoacán due to “ongoing security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity. Oseguera was wanted by US authorities, who offered a bounty of up to $15 million for information leading to his arrest. The US Justice Department charged El Mencho in 2022 with leading the effort to manufacture and distribute fentanyl for importation into the US. A Justice Department indictment of Oseguera said his organization is active in the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima, and Veracruz, and has a presence elsewhere. In a post on X, US State Department Deputy Secretary Christopher LandaudescribedOseguera’s death as a “great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world.” He added that he is watching the chaotic scenes in Mexico “with great sadness and concern.” The Michoacán Public Security Secretariat reported that “operational actions are ongoing at various points throughout the state to restore traffic flow in response to road blockades,” resulting from “efforts to capture criminal targets.” Meanwhile, the Guanajuato Security and Peace Secretariat reported fires at pharmacies and convenience stores in different parts of the state. “No injuries have been reported, but there has been property damage,” the statement added, announcing the deployment of a security operation in coordination with the Army, the National Guard, and municipal police. As a result of the violence, Air Canadasuspendedflights to Puerto Vallarta, a popular tourist destination on Mexico’s west coast. This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

            "Nigeria’s military said on Wednesday that about 200 UStroopsdue to arrive in the coming weeks would not take part in combat action and that Nigerian forces would retain full control over all security decisions. This followed comments from a US official on Tuesday that the Pentagon planned to deploy the troops to train Nigerian forces fighting Islamist militants, weeks after PresidentDonald Trumpordered against what he described as Islamic State targets. Last week, the US military confirmed it had sent asmall teamto Nigeria, without giving details, marking Washington’s first acknowledgment of personnel on the ground since the Christmas Day strikes. Major General Samaila Uba, spokesperson for Nigeria’s Defense Headquarters, told Reuters that Abuja requested the US presence to provide technical training and advisory work at several locations. “These personnel do not serve in a combat capacity and will not assume a direct operational role,” Uba said. “Nigerian forces retain full command authority, make all operational decisions and will lead all missions on Nigerian sovereign territory.” He declined to say when the troops would arrive, but said the deployment formed part of ongoing cooperation under the US-Nigeria Joint Working Group. Washington has stepped up pressure on Nigeria after Trump accused the West African nation of failing to protect Christians from Islamist militants in the northwest. Nigeria rejects allegations of religious persecution, saying its security forces target armed groups that attack both Christians and Muslims. US Republican lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill requiring the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress on US efforts to address what they called “ongoing religious persecution and mass atrocities against Christians in Nigeria.” The Nigeria Religious Freedom and Accountability Act of 2026 is sponsored by Riley Moore, who led a congressional delegation to Nigeria in December and has criticized the government for not doing enough to protect Christian communities. Nigeria faces overlapping security crises, including a long-running Islamist insurgency in the northeast, armed kidnapping gangs in the northwest and deadly clashes between farmers and herders in the central region, often driven by ethnic and religious tensions.\n",

But before becoming a champion, Liu had already given herself a crown of sorts, sporting a captivating hairstyle known as “halo hair” to make her podium intentions clear. Her iteration of the style features horizontal brunette stripes interrupted by milk-tea-colored rings, with bright blonde transitional lines. “Revived halos, who dis?” Liu captioned an Instagrampostlast month that she showed off her refreshed tree ring hairstyle. “OMG SO GOOD,” commented fellow US figure skater Bradie Tennell, with a fire emoji. Liu’s hairstylist Kelsey Miller also gave the skater her flowers when sharing various images onInstagramof the “angel halos,” describing her clientas “an inspiration.” “I hope the world never lets you down or tries to take your sparkle away from you!” Miller said, adding that she “can’t wait to see those halos spin on the ice tonight.” Miller said in an Instagramreelon Wednesday that she was “shocked” after receiving a request from Liu, who wanted her gingery tree rings turned a milk tea color, which is closer to platinum blonde. “Usually, I do it like a gingery color, but I was like, I want something different. Like, I want it lighter,” Liu toldNBCin January, adding that she ended up at the salon in St. Louis, Missouri, because she couldn’t get it as light as she desired with her usual DIY approach. Starting the style in 2023, Liu said she adds a stripe every year, which is why she now parades three rings in her hair. “So, it’s going to be like this for a year and then next year, wintertime, like end of December, I do another ring,” Liu added. Meaning, soon enough, she could have the five rings symbolic of the Olympic Games. Yet, wait for her to grin and another striking ring-shape is very clear – but this gem is in her mouth. Hanging over the skater’s front teeth, Liu has what’s known as the “smiley” piercing, which goes through her frenulum, the thin tissue between the upper lip and gum, and is visible when she smiles. The self-belief that drove her to be a champion on ice is no better highlighted than in her dauntless piercing experience. Liu toldTMJ4 Newsthat she got the piercing about two years ago, saying it was painless. “I did it myself,” she said, adding her sister helped and held up her lip.

            "A mother shot dead outside a supermarket. A man killed after leaving a mosque. A doctor gunned down while treating patients. These shocking cases are no longer anomalies: they are the toll of a violent crime epidemic sweeping across Israel. The victims are allPalestinian citizens of Israel. Homicides in their community have risen so dramatically that one person has been killed every day on average this year. Palestinian citizens make up 20% of the country’s population, and many say the Israeli government has not only failed to curb the crime wave, but that its inaction has helped spur a cycle of violence largely perpetrated by Arab organized crime groups. The data bears out a stark inequality: Israel Police has solved just 15% of homicides in Israel’s Arab communities versus 65% among Jewish Israelis, according to data from Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and Eilaf, the Center for Advancing Security in Arab Society. Palestinian citizens of Israel are descendants of those who were notexpelled or forced to flee their homeswhen Israel was established in 1948. They were given citizenship but lived under military rule until 1966, and many say they continue to face discrimination in Israeli society. Last year was the deadliest on record for the community, with 252 killed – the vast majority by gunfire – according to a report published byAbraham Initiatives,a group that advances social inclusion and equal rights for Israel’s Palestinian citizens. And 2026 is already off to a bloody start, with 46 killed so far, according to the group. It is a deadly reality that has raised alarm bells, with tens of thousands of the country’s Palestinian citizens taking to the streets in recent weeks – joined by some Jewish Israelis – to demand government action. “No to killing, no to death, we want to live in justice,” demonstrators chanted in Arabic at a January protest in Sakhnin, a majority Palestinian city in northern Israel, which drew tens of thousands of people. Attendees told CNN it was the largest demonstration the Arab community has seen in years, culminating a multi-day general strike from shop owners. What began there has since grown into a nationwide protest movement, with strikes and demonstrations taking place almost daily across Israel. Streets across the country were filled with a sea of black flags and water fountains were dyed red as citizens declared a “national day of disruption.” A week after the Sakhnin strike, Israeli President Isaac Herzog made a rare visit to the city, where he met with local Arab authorities and protest organizers. He said the fight against crime and violence in the Arab community “must be at the very top of the national priorities and be addressed with the utmost determination” calling it a “moral obligation.” And on Thursday, Israel’s Police Commissioner Daniel Levi declared crime in the Arab community “a state of national emergency” and “an intolerable situation that must stop.” He called on other government agencies to join the police in helping address the issue. For many Palestinian citizens of Israel, those declarations ring hollow. Qasem Awad has waited for more than a year for his son’s killer to be brought to justice. His son, Abdullah, a doctor from Mazra’a in the western Galilee, was treating a mother and her two children at a clinic last February when a masked gunman walked in and fatally shot him at close range. He was 30 at the time. Abdullah had been filling in for another doctor that day. His father believes he was mistaken for someone else. “If you look at the Palestinian Arab community in Israel, how many are being killed daily and for no reason?” Awad said. “These people have nothing to do with the world of crime. They are collateral damage, and my son is one of them.” In the days following Abdullah’s death, his parents say Israel Police visited and assured them they would investigate his death and identify the perpetrator. More than a year later, the pledge remains unfulfilled, and the family says it hasn’t heard from law enforcement authorities. If his son had been Jewish, Awad believes the killer would’ve been arrested “in an hour”. Like many others in his community, Awad believes the Israeli government intentionally neglects crime perpetrated against Palestinian citizens. “It is part of a policy to divide and conquer. ‘Let them kill each other while we sit back and relax,’” he said. Awad points to the speed with which Palestinian perpetrators are brought to justice in crimes against Israelis. “The technological tools and know-how are available for them to catch the killers. But when it is affecting the Arab demographic, they no longer have the tools or the know-how?” he asked. According to the Eilaf report, Palestinian citizens of Israel face “selective enforcement” of the law. “On the one hand, a tough approach towards political activity andfreedom of expression, and on the other, a soft approach towards criminals and crime,” the report said. In response to a query from CNN, the Israel Police said in a statement that a “thorough and complex investigation was launched” following the killing of Dr. Awad, where authorities have questioned “dozens of involved parties, with the aim of locating the suspects and uncovering the truth.” Data compiled by Abraham Initiatives shows that homicide cases among Palestinian citizens of Israelmore than doubled in 2023. That was far-right Minister of National SecurityItamar Ben Gvir’sfirst full year overseeing the police. Ben Gvir, who was convicted for supporting terrorism and incitinganti-Arab racism, has rejected responsibility, instead blaming local Arab leaders for turning a “blind eye” to criminal activity. Last month, he said he had “allocated enormous resources to the fight against crime and criminal organizations.” Critics say his actions speak louder than his words. Within months of entering office, Ben Gvir cut off key funding for an anti-Arab crime initiative called “Stop the Bleeding,” launched by the previous government. The next year, he dismissed the police official in charge of fighting crime in Arab society and put a lower-ranking official in his place. On Sunday, Ben Gvir defended the job he’s done, saying on Kan Reshet Bet radio that there have been “great successes” during his tenure. “I don’t work for the Arabs, not just for the Arabs,” he said. “I work for everyone.” “There is 20% less murder in the Jewish sector, let’s put that on the table … 60% fewer murders of Jewish women, and 20% fewer car thefts.” Ben Gvir said crime in the Arab sector is a “grave phenomenon” and he intends to “combat it.” But he blamed the Attorney General, with whom he has had an ongoing feud, and “40 years of neglect” from authorities for the surge, despite record killings during his tenure. The concern is not only the surge in killings, but the increasing brazenness with which they are carried out. According to Eilaf’s report, three out of four killings last year occurred in public spaces, indicating the “dangerous normalization of open crime… without any real fear of immediate intervention or effective deterrence.” “In light of weak governance, limited police presence, and declining trust in institutions, organized crime in Arab towns found a fertile ground for expansion, gradually building its economic and social influence by exploiting the vacuum left by the state,” said Rawyah Handaqlu, the head of Eilaf. She says the violence reflects the “exclusion and marginalization” of Palestinian citizens of Israel, arguing that the state has frequently relegated crime and violence to simply being a product of Arab society, which “holds society responsible for a reality imposed on it.” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Knesset who actively raises the crime issue in parliament, believes the first step to eradicate crime in the Arab community is to topple the right-wing government, which she describes as “racist, fascist and criminal.” “When the government is not acting… not holding the criminals responsible and not prosecuting them, it’s like sponsoring them,” she told CNN at the Sakhnin protest. “We want them to do the work they are supposed to do, and we want to give our young people the security to develop and to feel that they are living.” In December, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced plans to redirect $70 million from a program designed to promote Arab economic development to the police to address “severe nationalistic crime” in the Arab community. The Mosawa Center, a group advocating equal rights for Palestinian citizens, called it a “dangerous political step” that would do nothing to combat crime. “While the ministry fails to use the budgets already at its disposal, it is pushing to cut budgets allocated to other areas such as education and housing and transfer them to its own coffers,” it said in a statement. “This can only be interpreted as a deliberate policy of further impoverishing Arab society and plunging it deeper into crises, including the scourge of crime.” Back at his home in Mazra’a, Awad’s wait for justice continues. He finds comfort only in the photographs of his late son. Asked if he has any hope that there will be justice for his death, he sighs and points to the ceiling. “Justice only exists up there, with God.”\n",

            "For nearly half a century, Iran has prepared for a war with the United States. Unable to match America’s military power, Tehran has instead focused on ways to impose heavy costs that could shake the Middle East and the global economy. Even as negotiations with Iran continue, the US military is pressing ahead with asignificant buildupof air and naval assets in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump has hinted at regime change and warned he may strike Iran, stoking fears of a wider war. Despite being significantly weakened by Israeli and American attacks last summer andmounting domestic unrest of late, the Iranian regime retains a range of options to retaliate, experts say, from targeting US interests and Israel to mobilizing allied groups and pursuing economic disruption that could trigger global turmoil. How Tehran chooses to use the tools at its disposal depends on the level of threat it perceives it is facing. “The regime has a lot of capabilities to use if they see this as an existential war,” said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute specializing in the security and defense affairs of Iran. “If they see this as a final war, they might throw everything they have.” Here are the options ahead of Iran in case of a strike against it: Iran is believed to have thousands of missiles and drones within range of US troops based in a number of countries in the Middle East and has threatened to strike them, as well as Israel. In June,after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, the Islamic Republic retaliated by firingwave after waveof ballistic missiles and drones at Israel that inflicted damage by bypassing Israel’s sophisticated air defenses. Iranian officials claim many of the stocks used in that war have been replenished, and US officials believe that these battle-tested weapons, as well as aging Russian and American fighter jets, continue to pose a threat. Iran’s Shahed suicide drone, for example, has proved to be adestructive toolin Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Iranian regime has also developed, tested or deployed more than 20 types of ballistic missiles, including short, medium, and longer-range systems capable of threatening targets as far as southern Europe. “We have 30 to 40,000 American troops stationed across eight or nine facilities in that region,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubiosaidlast month. “All are within the reach of an array of thousands of Iranian one-way UAVs (drones) and Iranian (short-range) ballistic missiles that threaten our troop presence.” Two US officials told CNN that Tehran’s military capabilities, even if far outnumbered and much older than modern US systems, make a decisive US strike on the country far more difficult. Tehran hasrepeatedly warnedthat it would retaliate against US allies in the region if attacked. When US bombers struck Iranian nuclear facilities in the summer, Iran launched an unprecedentedmissile strikein Qatar, targeting al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US military installation in the Middle East. Over the past two years, Israel has battered Iran’s regional network of proxies, significantly curtailing the regime’s ability to project power beyond its borders. Still, the proxies have vowed to defend the Islamic Republic. Iraqi groups likeKataeb Hezbollahand Harakat al-Nujaba — militias that have targeted US forces in the past — as well as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, have said they will come to Iran’s aid if it is attacked. Last month, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, the commander of Kataeb Hezbollah, called on Iran’s loyalists “across the globe … to prepare for all-out war in support of the Islamic Republic.” Despite the threats, Iran’s proxies face constraints. In Lebanon, the once formidableHezbollahhas been significantly weakened after 13 months of conflict with Israel and now faces a domesticdisarmament campaign. In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias are powerful, but they too face hurdles from a central government that is under mounting US pressure to curb Iranian influence. TheHouthi group in Yemenhas been targeted by both Israel and the US, but it remains one of Iran’s most destructive surrogates, and it has also indicated that it will defend its patron. In late January, the Houthis released a video showing images of a ship engulfed in flames, accompanied by the simple caption, “Soon.” With Iranian support over the past few years, the group has struck Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel, as well as American ships in the Red Sea. Iran has repeatedly warned that a war against it would not be contained to the Middle East but would send shockwaves through the world. Though militarily outmatched, Tehran has leverage in its ability to disrupt energy markets and global trade from one of the world’s most strategically sensitive regions. Iran, one of the world’s biggest energy producers, sits on theStrait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway through which more than a fifth of the world’s oil and large share of liquefied natural gas flow. The regime has threatened to close it if attacked — a prospect that experts warn could send fuel prices soaring far beyond Iran’s borders and trigger a global economic downturn. Experts say that targeting the global economy through the strait may be one of Iran’s most effective options. It is also the most dangerous because of its widespread impact. A prolonged closure of the strait would represent a “dangerous scenario,” said Umud Shokri, a Washington, D.C.-based energy strategist and senior visiting fellow at George Mason University. “Even partial disruptions could drive sharp price spikes, disrupt supply chains and amplify inflation worldwide. In such a scenario, a global recession would be a realistic risk.” Such a move would likely be a last resort for Iran, as it would severely disrupt its own trade and that of neighboring Arab states, many of which have lobbied Trump against attacking Iran and pledged not to allow Washington access to their territory for an assault on Iran. Iran says it has naval bases deep underground across the country’s coast with dozens of fast attack boats ready to deploy across Persian Gulf waters. The military has spent three decades building its own fleet of ships and submarines with production ramped up over the past years in anticipation of possible naval showdown. Retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a former US Navy SEAL and deputy commander of US Central Command, said Iranian naval capabilities and proxies present a challenge for shipping in the Strait of Hormuz that “can be addressed very quickly.” But “asymmetric” tools such as mines, drones and other tactics could prove challenging for shipping and oil flow, he said. Iran’s ability to disrupt global shipping and shock the world economy has historical precedent. Toward the end of a prolonged war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran laid sea mines in the Persian Gulf, including near the strait, one of which nearly sank the USS Samuel B. Roberts in 1988 as it escorted Kuwaiti oil tankers during what became known as the “Tanker War.” In 2019, several oil tankers were struck in the Gulf of Oman during heightened tensions between Iran and Gulf Arab nations following Trump’s withdrawal from a nuclear agreement with Iran. Iran was widely believed to have been responsible. More recently, during the Israel-Hamas war, the Houthis disrupted commercial shipping at the Bab al-Mandab Strait in the Red Sea, through which about 10% of the world’s seaborne trade passes. Together with Iran’s ability to threaten traffic through the Strait of Hormuz, Tehran wields outsize power to inflict global economic pain. “The next war might start not in downtown Tehran, but in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf,” the Washington Institute’s Nadimi said.\n",

            "The statement from King Charles was swift, and stark. The authorities have “our full and wholehearted support and co-operation,” it read, and “the law must take its course.” Hours earlier, his brother had beenarrestedat his home on a private estate the monarch owns – Sandringham, north of London. Even by the standards of a family not unused to controversy, it was a stunning development. Brief at little more than 100 words, the King’s response – in his own name – could not have been clearer. “My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” it concluded. Translation: I will put my duty to the country before any residual sympathy I may have with my younger brother. It’s understood that Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales backed the statement – the most senior royals united in the strategy. The King’s tactics in dealing with the unfolding allegations aroundAndrewhave stood in contrast to that of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Andrew was, reportedly, her favorite son, and critics have previously said she did not act quickly enough to hold Mountbatten-Windsor to account for the repercussions of his friendship with convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein. Many have questioned why she allowed him to use Buckingham Palace as the location of his disastrous 2019 BBC interview in which he tried to bat away allegations of wrongdoing. Others have asked why the late Queen reportedly provided Andrew with millions to settle the civil sexual assault lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre in 2021. Despite the payment, Andrew always denied all of Giuffre’s allegations and said that he did not recall ever meeting her, despite having taken a photograph with her. In contrast, King Charles has been more decisive in dealing with his brother since coming to the throne in 2022. He had reportedly been exploring options to remove Andrew from his Windsor residence long before he stripped his brother of “prince” status and evicted him from the royal estate in October. Notably, Charles did not explicitly describe Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor as his brother in the statement released on Thursday. Neither King Charles nor the palace were given advanced warning of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, a royal source told CNN. The arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office is of course no indication of guilt, but it marks yet another extraordinary moment in Andrew’s yearslong fall from grace. Police say he has been released but remains under investigation. No charges have been filed. The former prince has not publicly responded to the latest allegations to emerge after the US Department of Justice released millions of documents related to Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior that Epstein was accused of. He has not commented on the recent allegations of misconduct in public office. But the events of Thursday, which began with a convoy of unmarked police vehicles arriving early at Andrew’s temporary lodgings on the Sandringham Estate on his 66th birthday, have left the British royal family staring down one of its biggest crises in decades. In some ways, the development was shocking but not entirely surprising, given the growing weight of the allegations against Andrew, which have cast a heavy shadow over the entire family for years. The palace said plainly last week that Charles would support authorities in their inquiries. If asked, that means that the palace could allow the police to access any internal communications between Andrew and others. Charles and Andrew are not thought to have been particularly close growing up, given their 11-year age gap. The King is known to have a stronger bond with his sister, Princess Anne. The brothers were perhaps closest in the 1980s after Charles married Diana and Andrew tied the knot with Sarah Ferguson, as the two women were known to be good friends. “Although the relationship has been more distant in recent years, when they were younger they were part of the royal family together, knew each other quite well and their families were close,” royal historian Kate Williams told CNN. She also said that the family now has “a huge problem on their hands, and it’s separating themselves from Andrew.” She expects the public might demand further accountability from the King and the wider family moving forward. “The question is going to be asked increasingly, ‘What did Charles know?’ And I think people are going to start saying, ‘What did William know?’” Williams said. “This is going to be the biggest challenge that the royal family has had on their hands since the death of Diana.” Royal commentator Sandro Monetti said “the Andrew issue has, and will, come to define King Charles’ entire reign.” “Despite all of the things that have been stripped away from Andrew, I would point out that he is still eighth in line to the throne,” Monetti added, before suggesting that calls for this to change may be heard in Parliament in the coming days. “The actions of which he’s accused put the entire future of the monarchy at risk,” he said.\n",

            "Nearly 150 years after the last giant tortoises were removed from Floreana Island inEcuador’s Galápagos archipelago, the species made a comeback Friday, when dozens of juvenile hybrids were released to begin restoring the island’s depleted ecosystem. The 158 newcomers, aged 8 to 13, have begun exploring the habitat they are destined to reshape over the coming years. Their release was perfectly timed with the arrival of the season’s first winter rains. “They are large enough to be released and can defend themselves against introduced animals such as rats and cats,” said Fredy Villalba, director of the Galápagos National Park breeding center on Santa Cruz Island, noting that the best specimens with the strongest lineage were selected specifically for Floreana. These released juvenile specimens, out of a total of 700 planned for Floreana, will be introduced gradually. According to Christian Sevilla, director of ecosystems of the Galapagos National Park, they carry between 40% and 80% of the genetic makeup of the Chelonoidis niger – a species that has been extinct for 150 years. The lineage of these hybrids traces back to Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island, a discovery that still puzzles scientists today. By selecting adults with the strongest genetic makeup, said Sevilla, the breeding program aims to gradually bring the extinct Floreana species back to its former purity. Two centuries ago, Floreana was home to approximately 20,000 gianttortoises. However, whaling, a devastating fire, and relentless human exploitation eventually led to their complete extinction on the island. “In genetic terms, reintroducing a species to that island with a significant genetic component of the original species is vital,” biologist Washington Tapia told The Associated Press. Tapia, a researcher and director of Biodiversa-Consultores – a firm specializing in the Galápagos Islands – emphasized that this process is about more than just numbers; it is about restoring a lost lineage. Floreana, an island spanning approximately 173 square kilometers (67 square miles), is a volcanic landmass and the southernmost point of the Galápagos archipelago. Situated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean – roughly 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the mainland coast – it remains a remote and vital ecological site. The tortoises reintroduced to Floreana will share their territory with a diverse population of nearly 200 people alongside flamingos, iguanas, penguins, sea gulls and hawks. However, they must also contend with introduced plant species such as blackberry and guava, as well as animals like rats, cats, pigs and donkeys. These non-native species, introduced by human activity, represent potential threats to the island’s newest inhabitants. Floreana resident Verónica Mora described the release of the turtles as a dream come true. “We are seeing the reality of a project that began several years ago,” she said, adding that the community feels immense pride in the return of the giant tortoises. The United Nations designated the Galápagos Islands as a Natural World Heritage Site in 1978. This honor recognizes the islands’ unique abundance ofterrestrialandmarine speciesfound nowhere else on the planet.\n",

            "The whole mountain rumbles when anavalancherolls off it. The swirling, whirling mass approaches like a steam train, picking up thousands of tons of matter on its descent, throwing clouds of snow into the air as its gathers speeds of up to 130 kph (80 mph). They are one of the most dangerous phenomena in the mountains.An avalanche in Californiakilled nine skiers on Tuesday, including six close friends. And this winter inEuropehas proven particularly deadly. According to the European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS), at least 99 people have died since October 2025, mostly in the Alps — the mountain range that serves as the continent’s skiing hub and sprawls across several countries including France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. In the French Alps alone, avalanches have killed 28 people since the first fatal accident of the winter on December 26, according to EAWS. That is a huge increase from the average eight deaths typically seen at this point in the season, according to France’s National Association for the Study of Snow and Avalanches (ANENA). In Italy and Switzerland, the avalanche death tolls are also much higher than normal. And, showcasing their awesome, frightening power, one avalanche derailed a train in Switzerland on Monday, injuring five on board, while another swept through a refuge on a French mountainside earlier this month, shattering windows and dumping snowdrifts inside the building’s kitchen. Avalanches require a combination of three things – snow, a slope steeper than 30 degrees and a trigger, such as fresh or melting snow, a person, an animal or wind. Of course, these are present in the Alps every winter but specific conditions have made this winter more dangerous than others, explained Stéphane Bornet, director of ANENA. After the first snowfall in November, he said, there was a long period of atmospheric high pressure where the snow on the ground evolved into “angular grains” — which look a bit like large sugar crystals and don’t bond effectively with surrounding layers. On its own, this type of snow isn’t dangerous. But, if covered by fresh snow, “these fragile layers can now be triggered and act a bit like ball bearings, like a conveyor belt that allows the avalanche to slide quite easily,” Bornet said. And, over the last few weeks, several meters of fresh snow have fallen across Europe, part ofa weather patterndriven by an unusual southerly jet stream that has dumped huge amounts of precipitation across the continent, causing flooding in lower altitude areas. At the same time, “the snowpack is being fed by the wind, which means we have a large accumulation of snow on the ground,” Bornet added. Such conditions prompted several regional avalancheforecast servicesto issue a severe level 4 warning for much of the last two weeks, with some areas even reaching the most severe level 5 warning, at least for a few days. Still, these dangerous conditions are unusual, but “not extraordinary,” noted Christine Pielmeier, an avalanche forecaster at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF in Switzerland. They can occur roughly every five to 15 years, she told CNN, emphasizing that this number is only a statistical guide, so the conditions could hypothetically occur over two consecutive winters or not at all over a longer period of time. Measuring how the climate crisis affects the frequency of these avalanches is difficult, scientists say. Weather is transient by its very nature — a similar weather pattern might affect an environment differently depending on the preexisting conditions — and comprehensive datasets aren’t really available. “It’s difficult to draw a direct link,” said Bornet. “We know that the climate is evolving; that is undeniable.” One effect we can clearly attribute to the changing climate is a fluctuating rain-snow line, meaning “we will have weather patterns bringing snow at very low altitudes and the next day, it might rain at 2,000 or 2,500 meters,” he said. In some cases, this will cause the “snowpack to consolidate through settling and bonding,” making it less prone to avalanches, “while in other cases, it could make the snowpack heavier,” he added. Mountains, even as they seem tamed by tourist infrastructure, remain wild and dangerous, particularly in these conditions. For many, that represents the appeal of backcountryskiing — a chance to test yourself against the terrain and to roam freely across the pristine snow, unbounded by groomed runs. Even with this temptation, most advanced skiers stick to marked slopes during dangerous conditions. But some, especially tourists who might have spent thousands of dollars on their week-long skiing holiday, are less likely to heed avalanche warnings. “You invest time and money, you can’t retrieve it, so you’d like to have some return for that investment and then that pushes the boundaries,” Audun Hetland, who studies decision-making in avalanches at The Arctic University of Norway, told CNN. And expert guides and skiers can take days to assess the terrain in challenging conditions — time that tourists simply don’t have, Hetland added. Several of those killed in recent weeks have been tourists. Backcountry skiing has become increasingly popular over the past few years, causing more and more people to venture into the back country. Yet, this shift in itself “doesn’t necessarily lead to more fatal avalanche accidents,” said Pielmeier. That’s because more of these people are often snowshoe hikers who normally avoid steep terrain.Meanwhile,backcountry skiers are being better educated about avalanches, have better equipment and enjoy better organized mountain rescue, she added. While conditions remain dangerous, experts advise reading the avalanche forecast, skiing with local expert guides and choosing shallower slopes to ski off-piste. The snow won’t remain this dangerous forever. Pielmeier expects the conditions to subside in much of Switzerland over the course of next week, once the new snow has stabilized, except in the south of the country where less snow has fallen. In some parts of France, however, Bornet expects the danger to persist for several weeks while the snow is still unstable.\n",

            "A man has been found guilty of grossly negligent manslaughter after leaving his girlfriend, who was “galaxies” behind him in terms of climbing experience, to freeze to death onAustria’s tallest mountainlast year, authorities said. The 37-year-old man, named in local media as Thomas P., was accused of having left his 33-year-old girlfriend, Kerstin G., alone as he sought help on Austria’s Grossglockner mountain in the early hours of January 19, 2025. The pair ran into difficulties while trying to reach the summit but there were conflicting accounts in court regarding the defendant’s attempts to seek assistance. The verdict could have implications for mountain climbers and how liable they are for the safety of companions. On Thursday evening, Innsbruck Regional Court in western Austria sentenced Thomas P. to a suspended prison sentence of five months and a fine totaling €9,600 (around $11,300), the court told CNN in a statement. The judge, Norbert Hofer, said the defendant’s girlfriend was “galaxies” away from his climbing skills and she assumed he would take “responsibility” for her, according to Austrian public broadcaster ORF. The maximum prison term for the offense of grossly negligent manslaughter is three years, the court said. In deciding the defendant’s sentence, the court statement said his clean criminal record was taken into account, as well as the “loss of a relative” as a mitigating factor. “It also took into account the public discussion on social media that had placed a strain on the defendant,” the court statement added. Thomas P. had denied wrongdoing and said his girlfriend’s death was a “tragic accident” which he was deeply saddened by, according to his lawyer, Kurt Jelinek. On Thursday, the court said the judgment was not final and is subject to appeal. “Appeals may be lodged within three days and must then be submitted in writing within four weeks,” it said.\n",

            "For American architecture, 2025 may be remembered for the deaths of iconsFrank Gehry,Robert A. M. SternandRicardo Scofidio, a mastermind of New York’s High Line. More likely, however, it will go down as a year dominated by Donald Trump — hispreference for classicismand disdain for brutalism; his controversial demolition of the White House’s East Wing; hisclasheswith the designer of the ballroom replacing it; and his administration’s move toexclude architecturefrom its list of “professional” degrees. Much of this has brought the presidency into direct conflict with the industry’s largest professional body, the American Institute of Architects (AIA). It perhaps came as no surprise that, amid the threat of national navel-gazing, the organization announced that it is awarding this year’s prestigious AIA Gold Medal to a non-American, Japan’s Shigeru Ban, for the first time this decade. Globally, there has been lots to celebrate. China’sLiu Jiakunwon the Pritzker Prize, the “Nobel of architecture,” for his understated academic and cultural buildings. Asocial housing developmentin London and ahumble concrete churchin Spain’s Canary Islands meanwhile beat out flashier competition to win two of the profession’s other biggest prizes. But 2026 may be shaped by bigger, blockbuster buildings. Among them are long-awaited museums, record-breaking skyscrapers and a soaring Catholic basilica almost 150 years in the making. Here are 11 of architecture projects — in the US and beyond — set to become the year’s most talked-about: Some 144 years after it broke ground, the world’s longest-running construction project is nearing completion. Well, in a sense. Work on Sagrada Familia’s sculptures, decorative detailing and proposed main staircase will likely stretch into the 2030s. But this year should see the 564-foot-tall Tower of Jesus of Christ, the basilica’s 18th and final spire (the 17 shorter ones are dedicated to the 12 apostles, four Evangelists and the Virgin Mary), finished in time for the centenary of architect Antoni Gaudí’s death in June. Gaudí only lived to see the first tower completed. The sheer complexity and decorative intricacy of his design, a surreal marriage of Gothic, Art Nouveau and nature-inspired forms, is partly behind the mind-boggling construction timeline. But funding shortfalls, bureaucratic hurdles and the Covid-19 pandemic all contributed, too. Perhaps the greatest challenge was the destruction of Gaudí’s drawings and plaster models in 1936, when his workshop was set on fire amid the Spanish Civil War. Whether he would have approved of the church’s final form — which is the bestestimation of his plansby subsequent generations of architects — will never be known. Though he probably wouldn’t have minded the wait. “My client is in no hurry,” Gaudí famously once said. He was, of course, referring to God. New York’s taste in skyscrapers is changing. The era of sleek glass facades is making way for grander, brawnier towers that nod to America’s architectural past. For evidence of this shift, look no further than the brooding silhouettes of the city’s two newest “supertalls”: JPMorgan Chase’s muscular, steel-heavy headquarters at 270 Park Avenue and the shadowy Brooklyn Tower, its crowned neo-Art Deco form clad in bronze and dark stone. The skyline’s next major addition, 520 Fifth Avenue, looks to the Beaux-Arts style that flourished in America’s Gilded Age. Topping out at 1,002 feet, the tower’s terracotta arches evoke a bygone era, with the “rhythm” of the ones located on street level informed directly by the tower’s 135-year-old Palazzo style neighbor, the Century Association. Architects Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) also cite the arched Grand Central Terminal and New York Public Library as inspirations — as well as the stepped cityscapes envisaged by Hugh Ferriss, whose moody illustrations heavily influenced Batman’s Gotham City. New York may feel a world away from the White House’s push for a neoclassical revival (or to “Make Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,” as Donald Trump’s executive order put it), but the city’s growing deference for history could be another side of the same coin. For a few weeks in February, this 11.5-acre site in southeast Milan will house thousands of athletes participating in the 2026 Winter Games. But the important question surrounding Olympic villages, like Olympic stadiums, is: What happens next? The recent history of the Games, both summer and winter, features a trail of wasteful temporary housing or long-term residences that were difficult to sell (Rio de Janeiro), poorly maintained (Athens) or out of reach for low-income families (London). In Milan, Italy’s most expensive rental market, architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) has designed an Olympic Village that can convert into an affordable 1,700-bed student residence within months of the closing ceremony. Helpfully, many athletes’ facilities — spaces for socializing, recreation and fitness — are needed by students, too. In fact, there’s so much overlap that Italian real estate developer Coima promises to have it ready in time for the fall 2026 semester. The project also presented an opportunity for urban regeneration. In addition to designing six new buildings, the architects restored two historic structures on the site, a former rail yard. And while the “village” moniker suggests a walled-off community, SOM considers this to be a “porous urban block” connected to the surrounding Porta Romana district via public pathways and green spaces. Future Olympic legacy planners will be watching with interest. The recentdeath of Frank Gehry, one of contemporary architecture’s greats, gives altogether new meaning to the opening of the Guggenheim’s long-awaited Abu Dhabi outpost. It was among several projects underway at the time of his passing (including Forma, a pair of stacked condominium skyscrapers in his Toronto birthplace), though this museum will surely be considered his swansong. A seemingly chaotic heap of curved and angular forms, varying in size, shape and texture, this is Gehry at his most playful. Yet, the design is not entirely self-referential: Its covered courtyards were inspired by those found across the Middle East, while the architect’s cone-shaped volumes nod — albeit abstractly — to “barjeel,” the traditional wind towers used across the region to passively cool buildings. Nonetheless, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi also owes a debt of gratitude to its Bilbao predecessor, a building considered by many to be Gehry’s magnum opus. The emirate’s leadership will also be hoping for a repeat of the architect’s so-called “Bilbao Effect” — a term now used any time an iconic museum puts a city on the map by attracting attention, tourism and investment — on Abu Dhabi’s Saadiyat Island. Whether Gehry’s death (or persistent construction delays) sets back the expected 2026 opening remains to be seen. When asked by CNN, a Guggenheim spokesperson simply said, “We look forward to announcing the official opening date in the future.” Africa is set to welcome its new tallest building: The 1,381-foot Tour F (or Tower F) in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Designed by Lebanese Ivorian architect Pierre Fakhoury, the 64-story skyscraper will surpass the current record-holder, Egypt’s Iconic Tower, by less than 100 feet. This sixth tower in Abidjan’s administrative district (after Tours A through E, which were all openby the early 1980s), Tour F been part of the city’s urban development plans formore than 50 years.Ivory Coast has, however, experienced significant political upheaval in those decades, including civil wars in 2002 and 2010. So, while the angled planes of the building’s glass facade are intended to evoke a stylized African mask, the tower’s symbolism runs much deeper than that. Whether a “supertall” high-rise is even necessary in a city whose population density is about a quarter that of New York’s is a legitimate question. But skyscrapers are not just about floor space. This one may project a message of stability to investors and the outside world. Transformative urban development projects are being planned across Abidjan, including a rapid transit system opening in 2028. A forthcoming 1,000-kilometer-long (621-mile)highwayconnecting Ivory Coast to Nigeria (via the capitals of Ghana, Benin and Togo) meanwhile speaks to the economic potential of West Africa’s “Abidjan–Lagos Corridor.” There’s nothing like a showpiece opera house to mark your city out as architecturally sophisticated. Just ask Sydney, Australia. In the last two decades, Guangzhou, Hangzhou andHarbinhave joined the list of Chinese cities commissioning renowned designers to oversee their opera venues. Now it’s Shanghai’s turn. The task falls to Snøhetta, a Norwegian architecture practice that has become something of a specialist in the field since opening a celebrated opera house in its home country’s capital, Oslo, in 2008 (the firm also has forthcoming venues in Busan, South Korea; Diriyah, Saudi Arabia and Düsseldorf, Germany). In fact, the Shanghai Grand Opera House’s design shares several key features with its Oslo cousin: a riverside location, an abundance of clean white surfaces and a flat profile that appears to emerge gently from the ground beneath. The iconic feature here, however, is a gravity-defying spiral staircase. It transports visitors to a huge rooftop plaza that (again, like Oslo’s) is open to the general public. The ammonite-like staircase also serves a wider aesthetic function, sitting at the center of a radial plan that seems to unfold around it like a fan. Upon opening, the venue’s three performance spaces — including a 2,000-seat main auditorium — will offer opera in both Western and Chinese traditions. Regardless of design, a center dedicated to Barack Obama in Chicago’s South Side was always going to get political. The former president’s opponents have already taken aim at the project’s soaring cost, the exclusion of a customary research library for unclassified archival documents (Obama’s presidential records are being digitized) and the decision to let the Obama Foundation, not the National Archives and Records Administration, run operations. The fact the Obama Presidential Center is anchored by a 225-foot-tall, obelisk-like marble tower — which some are nicknamed the “Obamalisk” — has provided further ammunition, with Republican senator Ted Cruz recentlyreferring to itas the “Death Star.” The New York-based architects behind the project, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, were an obvious choice. They were commissioned to co-design theUS Embassyin Mexico City during the Obama era; Joe Biden later appointed Tsien to chair the Commission of Fine Arts, the federal agency charged with advising the president on design. (She stepped down from the post earlier this year, shortly before Donald Trumpfired the commission’s remaining six members.) According to a design statement from the pair’s architecture firm, the showpiece museum tower “echoes movement upward from the grassroots,” its four faces intended to represent four hands coming together. The facade also features words from a speech that Obama gave to mark the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches, the grassroots civil rights protests that helped secure African Americans’ right to vote through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But there is much else to be found across the nearly 20-acre Jackson Park site, including a fruit and vegetable garden, a wetland walk, an auditorium and a branch of the Chicago Public Library. The center is also collaborating with major artists including Chicago-born Theaster Gates, who is creating alarge-scale collage friezeabout Black life using archival images from Ebony and Jet magazines. The Central Bank of Iraq’s new headquarters represents a bittersweet homecoming for Zaha Hadid. It is the late British-Iraqi architect’s only realized building in Baghdad, the city in which she was born and raised (before leaving to attend European boarding schools in the 1960s). But while Hadid oversaw the design, originally unveiled in 2011, her untimely death five years later meant she did not even live to see it break ground, let alone open. The tower represents an important moment for Iraq, too. Once closely controlled by dictator Saddam Hussein, the bank’s turbulent recent history mirrors that of the country itself. Just hours before the US began bombing Iraq in 2003, Hussein and his familystole around $1 billionin what has been described as the largest bank heist of all time. The institution has since been subject of ongoing debates over its role and independence in reconstruction-era Iraq. With an exoskeleton blossoming out from a narrow base like a champagne flute, the 558-foot tower is a striking addition to Baghdad’s distinctly low-rise skyline — albeit one that has been rapidly transformed by a recent construction boom. According to Hadid’s firm ZHA, which has remained prolific since her death, the company’s Instagram notifications are now full of young Iraqis proudly posting photos and videos of the tower while tagging Hadid’s name. If any building can be forgiven for resembling a spaceship come to land, it should be the one housing George Lucas’ new museum. The “Star Wars” creator’s $1-billion ode to visual storytelling opens its doors in September, more than a decade after he first floated plans for an institution dedicated to “narrative art.” For seven of those years, Angelenos have watched Chinese architect Ma Yansong’s futuristic vision slowly come to life, its curved, elongated form appearing to levitate over its 11-acre site in South LA’s Exposition Park. While Ma’s design feels otherworldly, his philosophy is fundamentally rooted in nature. The MAD Architects founder’s career-long crusade against straight lines and right angles is rooted in the idea that box-shaped buildings make cities feel “artificial,” he once told CNN. His vision for a “Shanshui city” — designs drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese shanshui (literally “mountain and water”) landscape paintings — can be found across China, and his firm has recently completed buildings in Europe and North America, too. But with more 100,000 square feet of exhibition space, this is, by far, the most significant building completed by any Chinese-born architect on American soil (excluding the late I.M. Pei, who was born in Guangzhou but became a naturalized US citizen early in his career). Billed as the largest overhaul of Melbourne’s rail network in 40 years, Metro Tunnel is a major feat of engineering. Costing13.48 billionAustralian dollars ($8.9 billion), the 10-year project connects numerous existing subway lines via two parallel 5.6-mile tunnels running deep — at points, more than 130 feet so — below the city center. After November’s soft launch, February marks the “Big Switch,” when operators add 1,000 more weekly services and the tunnels are fully integrated into the wider network. The new stretch of rail is served by five much-needed downtown underground stations. They were named from over 50,000 suggestions submitted by members of the public, including Anzac,  an acronym for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, whose bravery in battle is honored with a national remembrance day each April. Architecturally speaking, they are intended to forge visual connections with the streets above. For those closer to the surface, this means vast entranceways and skylights that bathe their concourses in light. Deeper ones, meanwhile, possess a more cavernous (or “cathedral-like,” as the architects put it) quality. The stations were a collaboration between three architecture firms, including Australian practice Hassell. In a statement, Hassell’s principal, Mark Loughnan, said each was designed to “celebrate the joy and efficiency of travel.” This may be a stretch for most Melburnian commuters, but they should certainly ease the transport demands facing a city that, in 2023,overtook Sydneyas Australia’s most populous. From ancient Greek temples to medieval churches, where the money flows, architectural innovation often follows. In the 2020s, this means, among other places, the Chinese tech industry. Giants likeAlibaba,TencentandXiaomihave all splashed out on big-name Western architects to mastermind their sprawling campuses and high-rise headquarters in recent years. Smartphone manufacturer Oppo is also on a building spree. Around the turn of the decade, the electronics company commissioned a series of major facilities, all featuring motifs of circularity and interconnectivity: Aresearch office,often dubbed the “Infinity Loop” (by in-demand Danish architect Bjarke Ingels); a futuristic Shenzhen headquarters comprising four conjoined,pebble-like towers(by Zaha Hadid Architects); and a huge R&D center envisaged as a series of interconnected circles (by US architects Kohn Pedersen Fox). The latter, located in the southern city of Dongguan, is expected to be the first to complete. Set across 115 acres, it is also the most staggering in scale. The project comprises 10 structures — seven of which are towers containing residences and serviced apartments for the 6,000 employees the campus will eventually accommodate. Despite spanning five city blocks and stretching across several major roads, the development’s many facilities (including a college, preschool, exhibition space and retail) can all be accessed without stepping foot outside the campus.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/20/style/melania-trump-inauguration-gown-smithsonian\n",
            "First Lady Melania Trump stood in front of reporters, supporters and colleagues at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History on Friday in an ensemble of frosty wealth essentials – a Bottega Veneta peacoat, leather leggings and Christian Louboutin snakeskin heels – and extolled the virtues of a slash of black fabric that zigzagged across the white column gown she wore for her husband’s second inauguration as president, just over a year ago. This was no mere ruffle or adornment; it was a black silk gazar summation of her biography, as imagined by her longtime stylist, designer Herve Pierre. “The meticulously formed black shape ‘Z’ on the front bodice summons decades of my early memories, life experiences, and influences,” she said. “And all of these stories are tucked deep within its crisp, strong seams — forever.” Trump was there to celebrate the addition of her gown to the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History’s First Ladies Collection – a tradition that dates back over 100 years and has resulted in one of the museum’s most popular exhibitions.  The museum’s director Anthea Hartig praised the historic nature of the moment, which she said would “help pave a new path as Mrs. Trump becomes the only modern first lady to serve two nonconsecutive terms,” sentiments the museum’s secretary, Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch III, echoed. “This is really a milestone in its own right — the first First Lady to be represented by two inaugural gowns in the more than 100 years of this museum.” (Unsurprisingly, President Donald Trump’s recurring fisticuffs with the Smithsonian, which led to theremovalof text mentioning the president’s two impeachments from the National Portrait Gallery, and to artist Amy Sheraldcancelinga retrospective in fear of censorship, went unmentioned.) Since Helen Taft first donated her 1909 inauguration gown to the museum in 1912, the Smithsonian has assembled more than two dozen dresses, among other pieces, from first ladies’ wardrobes. Bunch called the first ladies exhibition “as much a timeline on American history as it is a look on fashion.” There is Michelle Obama’s goddess-like 2009 white inauguration gown embellished with flowers, which made previously unknown American designer Jason Wu a fashion star; and the staid velvet and satin blue gown Barbara Bush wore for her husband’s inauguration in 1989, back when designer Arnold Scassi was the go-to society designer for an old money set that treasured looking a bit upholstered. Each of these looks reveals the priorities and ideals of their administration, in their color, mood and silhouette. Time goes on and a sleeve begins to look comically dated and then, a few years later, it is perhaps beautiful again. Like a president’s record, a dress’s meaning becomes more nuanced and reconsidered over the years. We reward ourselves, and our understanding of our past, by reassessing time and time again. Perhaps no first lady has been as meticulous about her style choices as Melania Trump.   While first ladies tend to demure from too much fashion chatter, lamenting the public focus on something so artificial, Trump has viewed it as, if not one of her most powerful tools, then her most treasured one. “Personally, I relish the entire design process, from start to finish,” she said on Friday. “It takes time, it’s slow, but the end result is always magical. If you had a chance to see my new film, ‘Melania,’ you are well aware of what it took to bring this technical marvel to life.” Indeed, the most riveting parts of the otherwise blah “Melania” are the extensive fittings Trump undergoes to ensure the correct cut of her Adam Lippes coat and wide-brimmed hat, and the clean lines of that white and black gown. She is a fashion authoritarian, insisting on an inch more here and less there, a slightly different sash at the neck. Pierre suggests she is so exacting because she was once a model, but there is something beyond a sartorial knowledge earned through relentlessly putting on and taking off clothes. It is a sublime vanity that possesses her and, strangely, allows her to judge her own appearance more harshly than any tailor or wealthy Birkin-ed clothes horse might. Thedefining featureof Trump’s two terms as first lady has been her obfuscation. Why does she wear her hats so low? Why does she sometimes dress in what appears to becostume? What in the world did she mean when she wore thatinfamous Zara fatigue jacketto the southern border? Ironically, Trump on Friday described the design of her inaugural gown as illuminating, almost idealistically simplistic: “The beautiful contrast between black and white sets a mood rich with emotion. American imagination appears in different creative forms, across all types of canvases—and often serves up a clear perspective. This dress speaks with a distinct point of view—a modern silhouette, bold and dignified, and ruthlessly chic.” We will never know why Trump makes the choices she does, in style or in public action. But behind all of the smoke and mirrors, her inauguration dress reveals, is a very direct mandate: her wish, above all else, to look exactly as perfect as she wants, all of the time.\n",

            "Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday passed new legislation that givesamnestyto hundreds of people who were prosecuted or convicted for political reasons during 27 years of authoritarian rule. Rights groups and opposition members havecautiously welcomedthe law, saying it offers an opportunity to ease the suffering of many, but that the process must be transparent and held to account. Some say the bill didn’t go far enough, and have questioned whether an amendment to one of the articles could prevent activists and opposition members in exile from receiving amnesty. Acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodríguez, who came to power after a US military operationremovedPresident Nicolás Maduro, proposed the new amnesty law last month under pressure from Washington. After signing the amnesty law, she described the moment as “an extraordinary door for Venezuela to reunite, for Venezuela to learn to coexist democratically and peacefully, for Venezuela to rid itself of hatred, of intolerance, let it open up to human rights.” Many in Venezuela – and the United States – will now be watching closely to see whether the country’s remaining political prisoners will soon walk free. National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez said more than 1,500 requests for amnesty were received by Venezuelan authorities on Saturday and that in the coming hours there will be “hundreds” of people released. Venezuela’s leading human rights organization Foro Penal confirmed to CNN that the first two detainees to be freed under the new law were released from prison on Saturday. Court records show that Luis Alberto Linares Sánchez and Milton José Hidalgo Mendoza, both teachers, were detained and accused of “inciting hatred and treason.” A court in the state of Barinas ordered that the charges against the two men be dropped in line with the Amnesty Law, and that they be released immediately, the document shows. The law will grant general amnesty to political prisoners processed or convicted since 1999 – the start ofHugo Chávez’s presidency– through to the present day. This includes many opposition figures, activists, journalists, students and others detained during protests in 2014, 2017, 2019 and beyond. However, the amnesty explicitly excludes those convicted or prosecuted for homicide, drug trafficking, corruption, grave human rights violations, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Lawmaker Jorge Arreaza, who presented the bill, highlighted these carve-outs to ensure the measure does not shield serious offenses. The text, published by the assembly, frames the law as a tool to “repair deep wounds” from political confrontation and promote peaceful coexistence. Hundreds of political prisoners are still locked up, according to human rights groups, and many of those released so far have faced restrictions and conditions such as travel bans, periodic court appearances and gag orders. In Caracas, thousands of students held a rare mass protest on February 12, during a congressional debate on the bill, to demand the unconditional release of political prisoners and the end of what they consider persecution against dissidents. The government announced last month it would free “a significant number” of prisoners in response to US pressure. Since then, more than 400 people have been released, according to Foro Penal, though the tally lags official claims of over 800. Among those released are a mother and her 6-month-old baby, who had been born in prison, the opposition said Thursday. No official public list of released individuals has been issued, but Rodríguez said she would invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights office to verify releases. Upon full passage, the law could trigger immediate mass liberations, with National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez assuring families that releases would occur swiftly post-approval. The bill passed its first discussion unanimously earlier this month, then advanced to public consultation before the final vote. Opposition leader María Corina Machado said the amnesty proposal was the result of “real pressure” from the United States, which has been demanding the release of all political prisoners since it ousted Maduro. Machado expressed hope it would free hundreds of remaining detainees but doubted Delcy Rodríguez’s capacity to lead a genuine transition. Rights organizations have also expressed cautious optimism. Foro Penal President Alfredo Romero said an amnesty was “welcome” if it was inclusive, non-discriminatory, free of impunity and contributed to the dismantling of political persecution mechanisms. The Venezuelan Education-Action Program on Human Rights said that amnesty should not be seen as a “pardon” or state grace, given that many detainees were arbitrarily imprisoned for exercising rights protected by the constitution and international law. Foro Penal Vice President Gonzalo Himiob added that amnesty does not imply admission of guilt or responsibility for any crime. Some have questioned if the law will truly guarantee the liberty of ex-detainees. Those concerns were heightened after Venezuelan opposition figureJuan Pablo Guanipa, who had spent eight months as a political prisoner, was re-arrested earlier this month, just hours after being released. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Guanipa had been detained for “calling people to the streets” – an apparent breach of his release conditions. The opposition denounced the move, with the party Alianza Bravo Pueblo saying, “The so-called amnesty, that veneer of false dialogue, is dead before it was born.” Guanipa is now under house arrest. Along with the amnesty bill, the government announced last month that it would close and repurpose the notorious El Helicoide detention center in central Caracas. Once envisioned as a futuristic shopping mall, the spiral-shaped building became synonymous with repression under the Maduro government, housing the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and holding many political detainees. Reports from former prisoners and rights organizations describe overcrowding, poor sanitation, extortion and abuse inside its cells. Rodríguez said the facility would stop functioning as a prison and be transformed into “a center of social, sports, cultural and commercial services” for the community. The move is meant to symbolize a shift away from the era’s repressive stance, though some critics argue the site should be preserved as a memory space for victims rather than repurposed commercially. The amnesty push comes against the backdrop of Venezuela’s fragile post-Maduro landscape, with the acting government under Rodríguez navigating US pressure, economic challenges and calls for stability. If enacted as promised, the law – and the expected closure of El Helicoide – could represent tangible progress toward reducing political tensions. However, rights groups say implementation, transparency in releases and broader reforms will determine its lasting impact on Venezuela’s pursuit of peace and democratic coexistence.\n",

            "A high-impactnor’easteris about to crush parts of the Northeast with blizzard conditions, heavy snow and strong winds. The forecast hasbeen fraught with uncertaintyfor days, but has finally homed in on a major storm from the Mid-Atlantic to New England, including New York City, Boston and other big cities. The storm will rapidly intensify intoa bomb cycloneoff the Eastern Seaboard Sunday, meaning we’re just hours away from the arrival of its worst conditions. Major to locally extreme impacts are expected from parts of the DelMarVa Peninsula into eastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, the New York tri-state area and southern New England, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index from NOAA. This means travel will be dangerous or impossible and widespread closures are expected. There are still some subtle differences in the forecast track of the storm that could make snow totals higher or lower in places, but the storm will pack a punch regardless. The most snow — potentially 12 to 24 inches — is most likely to fall near and east or southeast of Interstate 95 from around Philadelphia to New York City and Boston. This would be the firstfoot-plus snowstormat New York City’s Central Park in just over five years. Amajor winter stormabout a month ago came close to that mark by dropping 11.4 inches. The snow will be heavy and wet, the type that sticks to tree branches and power lines. When combined with winds gusting over 40 mph, tree branches could be snapped and scattered power outages are possible. Even higher gusts up to 55 mph are possible along the immediate coast. The powerful winds will push ocean water onshore like storm surge in a hurricane, making moderate to locally major coastal flooding possible from the Delaware and New Jersey to Long Island and southern New England. Peak water levels are expected with high tide either late Sunday night or early Monday morning. It all gets started during the day on Sunday when rain and snow develop from parts of New York into the Mid-Atlantic. Rain will change over to snow as colder air arrives. Conditions will go downhill dramatically Sunday evening into the overnight hours as the storm intensifies quickly off the coast. Strong winds and snow falling at rates of an inch or more per hour at times will expand north from the Mid-Atlantic to southern New England. The storm’s worst will still be hammering areas from Philadelphia to New York City and southern New England by sunrise Monday morning. Travel will be dangerous or impossible in these areas, with blizzard conditions expected along the coast. Snow and strong winds will ease up from south to north through the afternoon. By Monday evening, the storm will largely be wrapping up, but parts of New England will still be seeing the last of its impacts.\n",

            "A man has been charged with committing a hate crime after a car smashed into the gates of the biggest synagogue in Brisbane, the latest of a series of attacks on Australia’s Jewish community. The attack follows a string of assaults on Jewish people and their religious establishments in the country, as community leaders warn of a rise in antisemitism. In December, two gunmenopened fireon families celebrating the first night of Hanukkah at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach, killing 15 people, in the country’s worst mass shooing in almost 30 years. On Friday evening, a black pickup truckcrashed intothe Brisbane Synagogue, knocking down its gates, before being driven away, Queensland Police said. A 32-year-old man was later taken into custody after investigators located the vehicle, they added. Police said no one was injured. The man is due to appear before Brisbane Magistrates Court Saturday, to face a raft of charges including wilful damage, serious vilification or hate crime, dangerous driving and possession of a dangerous drug. Several anti-Jewish incidents have been recorded across major Australian cities in recent years, linked in part to anger over Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians since it was sparked by the deadly Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023. Israel’s government has repeatedly criticized its counterpart in Australia for failing to address antisemitic attacks in the country. Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit earlier this month following the Bondi attacksparked protestsat major Australian cities, including clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators with the police outside Sydney Town Hall. After Friday’s Brisbane attack, Queensland Premier David Crisafulli described the incident as “very concerning.” “This will be very distressing for the Jewish community in Queensland,” he wrote in a social media post, adding that he has already spoken with Jewish leaders and police. “I want to assure Queenslanders we are taking this seriously,” the premier said.\n",

            "Bill Mazeroski, theHall of Famesecond baseman who won eight Gold Glove awards for his steady work in the field and the hearts of countlessPittsburgh Piratesfans for his historic walk-off home run in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, has died at the age of 89. Pirates chairman Bob Nutting said “Maz was one of a kind, a true Pirates legend … His name will always be tied to the biggest home run in baseball history and the 1960 World Series championship, but I will remember him most for the person he was: humble, gracious and proud to be a pirate.” Mazeroski died Friday, the Pirates said. No cause of death was given. Elected to the Hall by the Veterans Committee in 2001, he was, by some measures, no superstar. Mazeroski had the lowest batting average, on-base percentage and stolen base total of any second baseman in Cooperstown. He hit just .260 lifetime, with 138 homers and 27 stolen bases in 17 years, and had an on-base percentage of .299. He never batted .300, never approached 100 runs batted or 100 runs scored and only once finished in the top 10 for Most Valuable Player. His best qualities were both tangible and beyond the box score. His Hall of Fame plaque praises him as a “defensive wizard” with “hard-nosed hustle” and a “quiet work ethic.” A 10-time All-Star, he turned a major league record 1,706 double plays, earning the nickname “No Hands” for how quickly he fielded grounders and relayed them. He led the National League nine times in assists for second basemen and has been cited by statistician Bill James as the game’s greatest defensive player at his position — by far. “I think defense belongs in the Hall of Fame,” Mazeroski said, defensively, during his Hall of Fame induction speech. “Defense deserves as much credit as pitching and I’m proud to be going in as a defensive player.” But his career’s signature moment took place in the batter’s box, as the square-jawed, tobacco-chewing Mazeroski, a coal miner’s son from West Virginia, lived out the dream of so many kids who thought of playing professional ball. The Pirates had not reached the World Series since 1927, when they were swept by the New York Yankees, and again faced the Yankees in 1960. While New York was led by Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, Pittsburgh had few prominent names beyond a young Roberto Clemente. They relied on hitters ranging from shortstop Dick Groat to outfielder Bob Skinner, and the starting pitchers Vernon Law and Bob Friend. Mazeroski, who turned 24 that September, finished the season with a .273 average and usually batted eighth. The series told one story in the runs column and another in wins and losses. The Yankees outscored the Pirates 55-27, and 38-3 in the three games they won. Mazeroski’s counterpart on New York, Bobby Richardson, drove in a record 12 runs and was named the series’ MVP — even though he was on the losing team. Whitey Ford shut out the Pirates twice, on his way to a then-record 33 2-3 straight scoreless World Series innings for the Yankees ace. The Pirates’ first three wins weren’t nearly so spectacular, but they were wins — and Mazeroski helped. He hit a 2-run homer in the fourth inning off the Yankees’ Jim Coates in Game 1, a 6-4 Pirate victory, and a 2-run double in the second inning off Art Ditmar in Game 5, a 5-2 Pittsburgh win. In Game 7, he saved his big hit for the end. Some 36,000 fans at Pittsburgh’s Forbes Field, and many more tuning in on radio and television, agonized through one of the fall classic’s wildest and most emotional conclusions. The lead changed back and forth as Pittsburgh scored the game’s first four runs, only to fall behind as the Yankees rallied in the middle innings and went ahead 7-4 in the top of the eighth. Pittsburgh retook the lead with five runs in the bottom of the eighth, helped in part by a seeming double play grounder that took a bad hop and struck Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek in the throat. But the Yankees came right back and tied the score at 9 in the top of the ninth. The bottom of the ninth has been relived, not always by choice, by the two teams and by generations of fans. The New York pitcher was Ralph Terry, a right hander whom manager Casey Stengel had brought in during the previous inning and would later acknowledge that he had a tired arm. The right-handed hitting Mazeroski, who had grounded into a double play in his previous appearance, was up first. Terry started with a fastball, called high for a ball. After conferring briefly with catcher Johnny Blanchard, who reminded him to keep his pitches down, he threw what Mazeroski would call a slider that didn’t slide. Mazeroski got under it and belted it to left, the ball rising and rising as it cleared the high, ivy-covered brick wall, with Yankees left fielder Yogi Berra circling under it, then turning away in defeat. The whole city seemed to erupt, as if all had swung the bat with him, as if he were every underdog who longed to beat the hated Yankees. Mazeroski dashed around the bases, grinning and waving his cap, joined by celebrants from the stands who had rushed on to the field and followed him to home plate, where his teammates embraced him. “I was just looking to get on base,″ he told The New York Times in 1985. ″Nothing fancy, just looking for a fastball until he got a strike on me. I thought it would be off the wall, and I wanted to make third if the ball ricocheted away from Berra. But when I got around first and was digging for second, I saw the umpire waving circles above his head and I knew it was over.” ESPN has called it the greatest home run in major league history. It was the first time a World Series had ended on a homer, leading to enduring waves of celebration and despair. Pirates followers memorized the date, Saturday, Oct. 13, 1960, and the local time of Mazeroski’s hit, 3:36 p.m. Forbes Field was torn down in the 1970s, but a decade later fans began gathering every Oct. 13 at the park’s lone remnant, the center field wall, and listened to the original broadcast. Meanwhile, Mantle would sob on the plane ride home in 1960, insisting the better team had lost. Ford would for years remain angry at Stengel — fired five days after the Series — for using him in Games 3 and 6 and making him unavailable to start a third time. Singer Bing Crosby, a co-owner of the Pirates, was so afraid he’d jinx his team that he listened to the game with friends across the Atlantic Ocean, in Paris. “We were in this beautiful apartment, listening on shortwave, and when it got close Bing opened a bottle of Scotch and was tapping it against the mantel,” his widow, Kathryn Crosby, told the Times in 2010. “When Mazeroski hit the home run, he tapped it hard; the Scotch flew into the fireplace and started a conflagration.” Mazeroski was a Pirate for his entire time in the majors and was a team man off the field. His wife, Milene Nicholson, was a front office employee whom he met through Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh. They were married in 1958, had two sons and remained together until her death in 2024. William Stanley Mazeroski was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, during the Great Depression, grew up in eastern Ohio, and lived for a time in a one-room house without electricity or indoor plumbing. His father, Louis Mazeroski, had hoped himself to be a ballplayer and encouraged his son’s love for sports, even practicing with him by having Bill field tennis balls thrown against a brick wall. Although a star in basketball and football, he favored baseball and was good enough to be drafted by the Pirates at age 17, in 1954. Mazeroski was a shortstop for a team with numerous prospects at that position, and had switched to second by his rookie year, 1956. Even as a part-time player at the end of his career, he was a leader and steady presence on the 1971 team that featured Clemente and Willie Stargell and defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. After his final season, 1972, Mazeroski coached briefly for the Pirates and the Seattle Mariners and was an infield instructor for Pittsburgh during spring training. In 1987, the Pirates retired his uniform number, 9. The 50th anniversary of his Game 7 heroics was marked in 2010 by the unveiling — on Bill Mazeroski Way — of a 14-foot, 2,000-pound statue of one of Pittsburgh’s greatest everymen, rounding the bases, on top of the world.\n",

            "Pakistan said Sunday it carried out airstrikes on militant camps across the border in Afghanistan, in a serious test of an uneasy peace between the neighbors. Pakistan’s information ministry said its military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to militants it blames for a recent series of deadly attacks on its soil. The strikes targeted thePakistani Taliban– also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – and its affiliates, as well as a group associated with the Islamic State. Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense confirmed the strikes in a statement, calling them a “blatant violation of Afghanistan’s national sovereignty” and a “clear breach” of international law. The strikes took place in civilian areas in the eastern Afghan provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, targeting a religious seminary and “multiple civilian homes,” the ministry said. Women and children were among the 18 people killed, Sayed Tayeb Hamad, a senior police official in Nangarhar, said on Afghan state television. The bodies of the victims were still being dug out from under the rubble on Sunday morning, according to state media reports. The airstrikes came after a month of deadly attacks within Pakistan, the most recent being the killing of two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel, by militants in the country’s northwest on Saturday, officials said. Earlier this month, dozens of people werekilled by a suicide blastin a Shia mosque in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad. Pakistan’s information ministry said on Sunday that the country had “conclusive evidence” that the February attacks were carried out by militants at the “behest of their Afghanistan based leadership and handlers.” This new escalation will test the delicate ceasefire that has been in place between the neighboring countries since last October, after theytraded their deadliest fire in years. Dozens of civilians were killed and wounded in theskirmishes that broke out along their disputed, 1,600-mile border.It culminated in Afghanistan launching retaliatory attacks after Pakistan conducted airstrikes on its capital Kabul. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring the TTP, which Kabul denies. In a November interview with CNN, Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan wanted to “take out” the TTP’s leadership in Afghanistan, stating that it would employ “whatever means are available to us.”\n",

            "Norway’s director of elite sport sounded a little hoarse when he answered the phone toCNN Sports. Tore Øvebrø said he had just caught a cold, but he admitted that his raspy voice might also have something to do with his cheering over the last two weeks. “It didn’t help,” he chuckled a few days ago. “I had to cheer just now because we’ve just won another gold in the Nordic Combined. We have 16, that’s the Olympic record, and we hope for a couple more. So, it’s fantastic!” Of course, the Games weren’t done then. Norway ended Milan Cortina 2026 with a record 18 golds – and 41 total medals. It’s now an indisputable fact: Nobody can touch Norway at the Winter Olympics. From 2018 in Pyeongchang through the Italian Games in 2026, the Norwegians have always come out on top. A tiny nation of roughly five-and-a-half million people – about the same as the US state of South Carolina – has figured out how to keep beating countries like China (1.4 billion), the US (342 million), Germany (84 million), Italy (59 million) and Canada (40 million). Clearly, they’re doing something right, and perhaps some of their rival nations like the US could learn a thing or two from the Nordic champions. It might come as no surprise that a Nordic country would excel in winter sports, but the truth is that Norway has been punching well above its weight in many sports for some time. Norway has recently produced Olympic champions in beach volleyball and several in track and field – two quintessentially summer sports. Their triathlon program is celebrated as the best in the world, Viktor Hovland is one of the top golfers, Casper Ruud made it to world No. 2 in the ATP rankings, Erling Haaland is one of the most feared strikers in the “Beautiful Game” and Ada Hegerberg won the most prestigious individual honor in world soccer, theBallon D’Or. There are many reasons for Norway’s success, but there is one common theme: An emphasis on fun and enjoyment that starts at the grassroots level. Until the age of 12 in Norway, nobody in youth sports is allowed to keep score, and there are no league standings either. As a result, there is far less destructive pressure and no reason to specialize too soon, and young athletes are encouraged to try out multiple sports. If one player gets a trophy, everyone gets a trophy; they want as many children as possible to return the following season. Such a small country can’t afford to lose athletes whose talent might not be fully revealed until their later teens. Norwegian coaches don’t tend to mistake early bloomers for talented athletes. “I find that many of the big sporting systems are more occupied with getting rid of people at the young age than develop many,” explained Øvebrø. “Why do I say that? It’s all about selection and selection is another way of getting rid of people. We are few. We have to take care of everybody.” Haaland played in the same mixed development group of 39 boys and one girl at Bryne FK until he was 16. The group was never broken up into first, second and third teams, nobody dropped out, and a handful of those players ended up turning professional. Johannes Høsflot Klæbo always thought he’d be a soccer player one day; in fact, he was sure of it . But he would come to realize that his true potential lay elsewhere – in Italy, he won six gold medals in cross-country skiing to become the most successful Winter Olympian of all time, his 11 gold medals surpassing three other athletes who had eight golds to their names. All are Norwegian, by the way. The sports development pipeline in Norway is less about trying to identify talent quickly and then turbo-charging the athletes to success, it’s more about letting them find their own way, ensuring that when they’re ready to join an elite-level program, they will make the most of it. “When you try different sports, you also meet different cultures and that means you develop the social skills to handle different kinds of people,” said Øvebrø. “There is a broad learning base and when you have those kinds of kids, it’s easier to build a high-performance culture; they know who they are, what they want. We like the kids to feel that they are in it for themselves.” The contrast with the system in the United States couldn’t be more stark. US comedian Josh Mancuso ridiculed the American travel baseball system, which starts at the age of 7, ina viral reelwhich has been seen by millions of people on Instagram. “First tournament is a regional in South Florida,” his coach character explained. “From there, we’ll head to Costa Rica and Ecuador for two more tournaments. You’ll need bats, gloves, cleats, pants, jerseys, specialty jerseys, carts, tents, chairs, speakers. This is basically the major leagues. … It will cost $27,000 per family.” “I think the video resonated with so many American families involved in travel sports because it’s one of those ‘it’s funny, but it’s not’ situations,” Mancuso told CNN Sports. “Parents are smiling through the pain while spending gobs of money on tournament fees, high-end equipment and name brand swag so their 11-year old feels like a MLB All-Star. I can’t lie though, I would have loved it all when I was a little slugger.” In every way, such programs are unthinkable in Norway, a highly egalitarian society, in which wealth and resources are distributed evenly. There are no barriers to entry in sports, nobody is priced out of participation. Geir Jordet is the professor of psychology and soccer at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo. He told CNN Sports that his country’s sporting success can be summarized in three words: “Collaboration, communication and care.” Once the elite athletes have been identified, they are helped to fulfil their potential in programs that utilize cutting edge knowledge, science and technology, including the functional use of psychology. “The top Olympic Sports Center is 10 meters away from the Sport University where I’m currently sitting right now,” he said, emphasizing that Norway’s diminutive stature facilitates collaboration within the elite sports community. “There’s a very strong sharing culture across sports in Norway and also from academia and from science to sport. There are very short lines of communication when it comes to knowledge. People come to that center from different sports, they meet there, they train there together, they communicate and they learn from each other.” A rising tide lifts all boats in Norway, and – whether it’s athletes, programs or sports – they cooperate with other for as long as possible, they only compete when they must. Author Brad Stulberg, who recently published “The Way of Excellence,” is fascinated by the Norwegian approach, especially as he contrasts it with his own experience as a parent and coach in the US. “I think that Americans could learn a lot from the Norwegian model,” he told CNN Sports, “especially the emphasis on fun and participation over winning. The data is very clear, the number one reason that kids quit sports is because it’s no longer fun. The number two reason is because they feel too much pressure.” When Stulberg highlighted the reasons for Norway’s success in a post on Instagram, he says that some of the responses in the comments seemed to be triggered. “So many Americans just get deeply offended by this idea,” he explained. “It’s a lot of, like, batsh*t crazy parents who feel called out because they are on the sidelines screaming at referees at their eight-year old’s baseball game. It just makes no sense; the parents need to put the kids first. It behooves us to keep sports fun, to try to release the pressure, to develop a love for sport and then keep them in sport so that later on they can be competitive.” Tore Øvebrø says that by the age of 25, 93% of Norway’s population has been involved in some kind of organized sports. Conversely, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported in 2024 that 70% of youth athletes drop out of organized sports by the age of 13 – injury and burnout are the principal reasons why. “Discontinuation of sports during childhood plays a role in the more than 75% of adolescents in the United States who fail to meet physical activity recommendations,” said the report.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/16/middleeast/dana-eden-tehran-israel-dead-athens-intl\n",
            "Dana Eden, anIsraeliproducer best known for co-creating the Apple TV show “Tehran,” was found dead on Sunday in Athens, where the show’s fourth season was being filmed, Greek police said. Eden, 52, was found dead in a hotel room after a relative made several failed attempts to reach her. Police said that her death is being treated as a suicide, Reuters reported. “We mourn the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series and programs at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, said in a statement. Kan said that Eden had traveled to Greece to oversee the “complex and significant production” of the fourth season of “Tehran,” a spy thriller that premiered in 2020 and received an International Emmy Award in 2021 for best drama series. “Her professional work, uncompromising commitment and love of creation have left a deep mark on the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan added. “Tehran” follows the plight of Tamar Rabinyan, a young Mossad agent born in Iran but raised in Israel who returns to Iran on a mission to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. Since Israelis are banned from visiting Iran, the show was filmed in Athens, due to its similarities with the Iranian capital. In her Emmy acceptance speech, Eden said that working on the show with Iranian actors who had fled the regime showed her that “we have a lot in common.” “Tehran is not only an espionage series. It’s also about understanding the human behind your enemy,” she said. “I hope we can walk together – the Iranians and the Israelis, in Jerusalem and in Tehran – as friends, and not as enemies.” Much of Eden’s work was in collaboration with Shula Spiegel, who also worked as a producer on “Tehran.” The pair’s production company, Dana and Shula Productions, said Eden’s death was “a moment of great pain for the family, friends and colleagues.” Miki Zohar, Israel’s culture minister, said he received the news of Eden’s death “with great sadness,” praising her as “one of the most prominent and influential producers in the Israeli television industry.” “Dana left a deep mark on Israeli creation and brought our story to international stages with pride, talent and courage. I share in the sorrow of the family, friends and colleagues. May her memory be a blessing,” Zohar said.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/20/europe/britain-air-base-access-us-iran-intl-hnk-ml\n",
            "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has blocked a request from US President Donald Trump to allow US forces to use UK air bases during any preemptive attack on Iran, saying it could break international law, according to multiple reports in British media citing government sources. According toThe Timesof London, which first reported the split over airbase access, Starmer has denied the use of RAF Fairford in England and Diego Garcia – the British overseas territory in the Indian Ocean – for any strike on Iran. The two bases have long served as crucial overseas US military staging posts for operations far from home, with Diego Garcia a key airfield for the US’ heavy bomber fleet. The Times reports Britain is concerned that allowing the US to use the bases “would be a breach of international law, which makes no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those in support if the latter have ‘knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act.’” The Times cited UK government sources. The BBC, The Guardian and The Telegraph also subsequently published their own reports on the UK blocking access to the bases, citing sources. The UK Ministry of Defence declined to comment on what it called operational matters. “There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports. Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region,” a government spokesperson said. American requests to use UK bases for operational purposes historically have been considered on a case-by-case basis, with precise criteria withheld for security reasons under long-standing agreements. “All decisions on whether to approve foreign nations’ use of military bases in the UK for operational purposes considers the legal basis and policy rationale for any proposed activity,” Veterans Minister Al Carns wrote in response to questions from independent British member of parliament Jeremy Corbyn, according to a Januaryreport from the UK Defence Journal. Starmer and Trump held a phone call on Tuesday evening, with readouts saying the two discussed peace in the Middle East and Europe. The following day Trump took to his Truth Social platform to withdraw support for a deal that would see sovereignty overthe Chagos Islands, the Indian Ocean chain that is home to the joint US-UK Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, handed to Mauritius in return for a 99-year lease on the military base. CNN has approached the White House for comment. Britain had split the Chagos Islands from Mauritius before that colony gained independence, something that has been a source of diplomatic friction as well as multiple legal battles with locals who were evicted. In 2019, the International Court of JusticeruledBritain should return the islands “as rapidly as possible,” so that they could be decolonized. Adeal to return themhas been making its way through British government channels since, with London arguing a lease compromise would ward off further expensive and likely futile legal battles while maintaining military access in the Indian Ocean. After initially opposing the UK-Mauritius deal, Trump in early February said it was the “best” Britain could get under the circumstances. But as the US has been surging forces into the region for a possible attack on Iran, Trump reversed course, saying in a Truth Social post that Starmer is “making a big mistake” in agreeing to the lease deal with Mauritius. “Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before. In our opinion, they are fictitious in nature,” Trump’s post said. But just a day earlier, the US State Department issued a statement saying in part that Washington “supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius.” Asked about the discrepancy between the Truth Social post and the State Department statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s post should be taken as the “policy” of the Trump administration. In his social media post, Trump directly referenced the two UK airbases, cited by British media, as important in a possible strike on Iran. “It may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime,” Trump wrote. Neither Diego Garcia nor Fairford, the key forward operating base for US strategic bombers in Europe, was used in last June’s one-time B-2 bomberstrike on Iranian nuclear sites. In that case, the stealth bombers flew a round trip of about 37 hours from their home base in Missouri. But analysts are expecting that any new US attack on Iran might be a much longer campaign, possibly of weeks or more. In such a campaign, having the B-2s, as well as B-1 and B-52 bombers, using bases thousands of miles closer to Iran would enable quicker turnarounds to rearm and refuel for more strikes. While the US may have access to other bases in friendly countries closer to Iran, using them could put its prized heavy bomber fleet in reach of retaliatory Iranian missile strikes.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/asia/north-korea-multiple-rocket-launchers-intl-hnk-ml\n",
            "North Korea’s Kim Jong Un took the wheel of a nuclear-capable multiple rocket launcher at a ceremony in the capital Pyongyang, according to the country’s state media, and touted the weapon as among the most powerful of its type in the world. North Korean state media routinely puts out eye-catching images of its leader as a way to bolster his reputation domestically – and send threatening messages to perceived enemies. The authoritarian one-party state is preparing for a key party congress this month, a time when North Korea’s propaganda machine and displays of its military often kick into overdrive. Wednesday’s display comes as North Korea continues to support Russia in its illegal invasion of Ukraine, supplying Moscow with missiles and thousands of troops. Analysts say the experience North Korea’s military is gaining in the fight against Ukraine – along with possible technical know-how from Moscow – can help it refine its weapons and tactics. Relations also remain tense between Pyongyang and Seoul, which is supported by tens of thousands of US troops. The latest North Korean state-media footage showed 50 carriers of the 600mm-rocket system lined up in rows of seven in a square. Each of the four-axle transporters and launch vehicles carries five rocket tubes. Images showed Kim in a black jacket, alighting a mobile missile launcher near the main stage as thousands of people waved small North Korean flags. A photo also showed him with a big smile as he sat behind the wheel. “He personally drove a launcher vehicle to review the weaponry symbolic of absolute power lined in the plaza of the venue for the glorious Party Congress,” North Korea’s state-run KCNA news agency said in its report. Kim said the 600mm rockets – double the size found in most multiple rocket launch systems – are as good as short-range ballistic missiles. And their use of artificial intelligence in their guidance systems puts them in a class by themselves. “No other nations have got this kind of weapon system,” Kim said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. It “has completely changed the role and conception of artillery accepted by modern warfare.” This isn’t the first time Kim is touting the 600mm launchers. In late 2022, his regimeshowed off 30 launchersof the same size rockets, but those were on tracked vehicles each carrying six rockets. According to a KCNA report then, the rocket system has all of South Korea in its range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads. However, international monitors believe North Korea only possesses around 50 nuclear warheads, with the fissile material to make 30 to 40 more. Besides the multiple rocket launch systems, Pyongyang has a range of nuclear delivery vehicles, from intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike the mainland United States, to short-range weapons that would ostensibly be used on the Korean Peninsula or to targets adversaries in the Western Pacific. North Korea has thousands of conventional artillery pieces, which could wreak havoc on South Korea. Two years ago, it stageda massive firepower demonstration“of the long-range artillery sub-units near the border who have put the enemy’s capital in their striking range,” KCNA said at the time. A 2020 report from Washington-based think tank RAND Corp. said North Korea’s artillery systems, with nearly 6,000 big guns within range of major South Korean population centers, present as great a danger to the South as Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. “If fired at civilian targets, those nearly 6,000 systems could potentially kill more than 10,000 people in only an hour,” the RAND report said. The wheeled launchers on display Wednesday were in front of the April 25 House of Culture in Pyongyang. Red banners and signs for the upcoming Ninth Party Congress surrounded the military display. Pyongyang often shows off new weaponry before party gatherings, key events and anniversaries. Kim on Wednesday hinted more military hardware may be shown off in the coming days. “The Ninth Congress of our Party will make clear the next-stage plan and goal for strengthening the self-reliant defense capabilities,” Kim said, while calling on weapons developers and those assembling munitions to work harder to execute the party’s strategic plan.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/tech/ai-jobs-big-thing-hype\n",
            "AI is either your most helpful coworker, a glorified search engine or vastly overrated depending on who you ask. And no one seems to agree on which is right. Tech executives championing AI have long spun the narrative that the tech will revolutionize jobs and bring about a new industrial revolution. Skeptics think it’s all marketing hype, while some researchers and executivesare sounding the alarmabout safety concerns on their way out the door. The discrepancy in how people view AI has perhaps never been so apparent as this past week, aftera viral essayfrom an AI CEO and investor claimed the tech is coming for any job that involves sitting in front of a computer. But there may be a simpler explanation as to why people have taken such divergent stands: People use different types of AI in different ways, yet it’s all being referred to in the same way. “There’s just a wide spectrum of how much people have been exposed to the technology, how much they’ve used the technology,” said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures who has led investments in AI companies including Anthropic. “And that’s also changing pretty rapidly.” People who use free AI for basic tasks like making grocery lists and planning vacations are likely only seeing one side of the technology. Areport from Menlo Venturespublished last June estimated that only 3% of AI users are paid subscribers, although Murphy told CNN he expects that to change quickly. But those who pay get access to another feature: Agents that can handle some work for you rather than just chatbots that craft responses, plus fewer limits on usage. Anthropic’s Claude Cowork agent, for example, is only available in the $20-per-month Pro plan and higher. The case is similar for OpenAI’s Codex coding agent. It’s that type of AI that’s fueling concerns about AI’s impact on jobs, including the controversial argument Matt Shumer, an investor and former CEO of AI startup, gets at in his viral essay. “I’ll tell the AI: ‘I want to build this app. Here’s what it should do, here’s roughly what it should look like. Figure out the user flow, the design, all of it.’ And it does. It writes tens of thousands of lines of code,” Shumer wrote. He went on to claim that the AI was able to test the app and make decisions concerning taste and judgment. And he surmised that if AI could write code that well, it could begin improving upon itself, as well. (AI researchersaccused Shumer of exaggeratingthe performance of his AI model in 2024. He apologized at the time and told CNN it was the “biggest mistake” of his “professional life” and that he learned through the process). Some experts are skeptical the use cases Shumer outlined are possible even with paid plans, especially since he was vague about which model he used and what type of app the AI built for him. Shumer told CNN he primarily uses OpenAI’s GPT-5.3 Codex tool and that he was working on a “medium to high complexity app” for testing purposes. Still, the free version of AI apps doesn’t paint the full picture of what the technology is capable of, according to Emily DeJeu, a professor who teaches courses about the use of AI in business at Carnegie Mellon University. She said it would be “misguided” to make assumptions about AI’s capabilities based solely on free AI services. Oren Etzioni, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and previous CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, described the gap between the free and paid tiers of AI like comparing an eager yet inexperienced intern with a seasoned, hard-working intern. Free AI tiers are good at writing summaries and generating content, but users will typically have to pay to conduct deep research or draft sophisticated documents using AI. While free AI can “give you surprisingly good advice” and “engage with you in a surprisingly sophisticated dialog, you wouldn’t want to use one of those as your attorney or even as your paralegal,” he said. But AI companies are increasingly trickling more advanced features down to the free tier, which is part of why James Landay, cofounder of the Stanford Institute for Human Centered AI, said he doesn’t see a big difference between free and paywalled AI. Case in point: Anthropic launched a new model called Sonnet 4.6 on Tuesday that it says will bring performance closer to its more advanced Opus models only available in its paid plans. Software stocksplummeted in early Februaryafter AI company Anthropic released a tool tailoring its AI helper specifically for individual industries, like legal and financial analysis. That launch, followed by Shumer’s essay, stoked concerns that AI will eventually broadly automate knowledge work the way it’s starting to streamline software engineering jobs. Yet there’s also growing skepticism about whether AI is living up to these lofty declarations, often made by tech executives with financial interests in the technology’s success. Some studies have poured cold water over how capable AI truly is and how quickly it’s being adopted. Agroup of researchersfrom the Center for AI Safety and Scale AI found last year that leading AI models produced flawed results when tasked with work assignments like visualizing data and coding video games. An organization that tests AI models calledModel Evaluation and Threat Researchfound in July that developers take 19% longer to work on their code when using AI, although that research was based on tools from early 2025. Landay also says the role AI is playing in software development is overstated in the essay. AI is a helpful tool that programmers use to speed up development, but it’s still prone to mistakes, and AI models aren’t writing themselves. While experts have widely agreed AI will change many industries, AI’s proficiency at coding shouldn’t be taken as a sign that it’ll perform the same way in other professions. “(Coding is) also a logical structure, which is a really good fit for a machine to also be able to test the code and see if it works,” he said. “Many people’s jobs are not structured in that way.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/tech/takeaways-mark-zuckerberg-testifiessocial-media-child-mental-health\n",
            "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday testified before a jury for the first timeabout accusations that social media, including Instagram, harm children’s mental health. Kaley, a 20-year-old woman, alleges Instagram and Google’s YouTube were intentionally designed to be addictive — and that they hooked her from an elementary school age, causing anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia. The outcome ofher lawsuitcould affect the hundreds of other cases by families who say their own children have been harmed or even died because of social media. Meta, for its part, denies the accusations and says it’s implemented numerous measures to safeguard young users. At the core of the testimony were questions about what Meta knew about the potential risks to young people and whether it did enough to mitigate them. Zuckerberg argued he aims to build a product that has long-term appeal, not one that gets people hooked in the short-term and makes them feel bad about themselves. Here’s what we learned. The lawsuit alleges that Meta designed its platforms to keep users scrolling  and juice profits, a key line of questioning Wednesday. While Meta previously had time-specific goals for Instagram, Zuckerberg said, it’s now focused on “utility and value.” Kaley’s lawyer Mark Lanier showed an internal document in which Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the short-form video Reels feature had “driven time to all-time highs” and that his personal “stretch goal was to get on track to pass TikTok in terms of time spent.” “The way I read this, we try to increase the value of our services, but also trying to measure progress against competitors like TikTok,” Zuckerberg said, adding that time spent was a proxy for measuring Instagram’s success against competitors. Lanier  showed a 2022 document of “milestones” for Instagram that projected average time spent on the platform would grow from 40 minutes in 2023 to 46 minutes in 2026. Zuckerberg disputed that milestones are goals. “If we do good work, this is something we expect to see,” he said. Users can alter photographs with Instagram’s beauty filters, mimicking plastic surgery or other alterations. Lanier argued the filters could harm teens’ perceptions of themselves, saying experts consulted by Meta reached that same conclusion. The company decided to allow the filters, but not recommend them,in the name of free expression, Zuckerberg said. Denying users the tools would have been “paternalistic” he added. Later, Lanier showed an email that he said was sent by a Meta employee to Zuckerberg. The employee, a mother of two teen girls, warned about the filters and said the pressure on teen girls is intense. “I respect your call and I support it, but I want to say for the record, I don’t think it’s the right call,” read the employee email. Instagram says it requires users to be﻿at least 13 years old to create an account — a policy Zuckerberg reiterated on the stand. But an internal document from 2015 estimated over 4 million Instagram users were under 13, which it said represented “30% of all 10-12 year olds in the US.” Kaley began using Instagram at age 9, Lanier said previously. Instagram didn’t begin asking new users to input a date of birth until December 2019; previously, it just asked users to confirm they were above the age of 13. Instagram in August 2021 started asking existing users to provide a birthdate if they hadn’t done so previously. That means Kaley wasn’t asked for her age at all when she joined the platform. Lanier also showed an internal document that read, “if we want to win big with teens, we must bring them in as tweens.” Zuckerberg argued the company landed on the right policy for verifying users’ ages after initially weighing privacy concerns. He added that Meta and many other social media companies struggle to accurately confirm young users’ ages because teens often lack government-issued IDs or other forms of verification. Meta now says it uses AI to estimate users’ ages and enforce its teen safety measures. He also estimated that teens make up less than 1% of Instagram’s revenue. “Most teens don’t have disposable income, so they’re not valuable for advertisers,” he said. (Parents and advocates have for years claimed that Meta targets young users not for their immediate buying power, but in hopes that they’ll become long-term users.) Meta lawyer Paul Schmidt on Wednesday also showed a 2018 email from Zuckerberg to Apple CEO Tim Cook in which he expressed a desire to ensure “technology improves people’s wellbeing,” including Facebook and Instagram. There was a packed courtroom listening to the Meta CEO testify. But one audience member in particular stood out: Kaley. Kaley, now 20, has social anxiety and difficulty in crowds, Lanier previously said, so she would not be present for much of the trial. (She is expected to testify later.) Meta has argued that Kaley’s difficult childhood caused her mental health challenges, not its products. But Lanier suggested Wednesday that Kaley’s upbringing made it even more important that Meta safeguard vulnerable users, asking Zuckerberg if a company should “prey upon” people who come from difficult backgrounds or are “less fortunate in educational opportunities.” “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people who use its services,” Zuckerberg replied. Later in the day, Lanier brought out a poster so long it needed seven people to hold it, crammed with hundreds of photos from Kaley’s Instagram account — hammering home the countless hours he said she spent on the platform. Nearly a dozen parents who say their children were harmed or died because of social media gathered and joined hands outside the courthouse Wednesday morning as they waited for Zuckerberg to arrive. Among them were parents who were also in the audience during Zuckerberg’s 2024 congressional testimony,when he surprised many watchers by turning around to face the audience andapologize to familieswho said their children had been hurt by his platforms. That 2024 moment echoed through Wednesday’s hearing. Tammy Rodriguez was one of the parents who attended both hearings. Her 11-year-old daughter Selena died by suicide in 2021 after struggling with an alleged addiction to Instagram and Snapchat. Rodriguez was the first of more than 1,500 individuals to file a civil case against the social media platforms; her suit’s outcome could depend in part on how the jury in Kaley’s suit decides. She compared Wednesday’s testimony to the 2024 congressional hearing. “I don’t have any satisfaction,” she said after Zuckerberg concluded. “I feel just like I did when I left that day (in 2024), but we’re here and we’re in a courtroom, so that’s a big thing,” Rodriguez said. “I can’t say after today, but I believe that there will be change.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/15/middleeast/israel-advances-registration-of-west-bank-territory-as-state-land-intl-latam\n",
            "The Israeli government has advanced the registration of territory in theoccupied West Bankas state land in a move that Palestinians have decried as “de facto annexation.” For the first time sinceIsrael occupied the territory in 1967,the government will create a mechanism to officially register large swaths of land under the state. Israel’s Foreign Ministry defended the move as an “administrative measure” which would “bring order” to land registration. But government ministers made clear the intent was to increase settlement and entrench Israel’s grip on the land. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalal Smotrich said the land registry would continue “the settlement and governance revolution across all parts of our land” as he referenced Judea and Samaria, the biblical term for the West Bank. And Justice Minister Yariv Levin said Israel is “committed to strengthening its hold over all parts of our land, and this decision expresses that commitment.” The government’s new measure will apply to what is known as Area C of the West Bank, about 60% of the territory and home to an estimated 180,000-300,000 Palestinians and to a settler population of at least 325,500, according to Israeli human rights group Btselem. The Palestinian Presidency said the decision violated international law and amounted to “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory.” In a statement, the president’s office warned that the move was a “declaration of the annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity.” Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and subsequently began establishingJewish settlementsthere, which are considered illegal under international law, by the United Nations and by much of the international community. The UN also regards the West Bank and East Jerusalem as occupied territory, which the Palestinians seek for a future state. Peace Now, an Israeli settlement watchdog, described the government’s move as “a massive land grab in the West Bank … completely against the will of the people and contrary to Israel’s best interests.” The Israeli government approved the measure despite US President Donald Trump’s stated opposition to annexation of the West Bank. “We warn President Trump - Netanyahu is deceiving you! You said you wouldn’t allow annexation, but he’s carrying it out right under your nose,” Peace Now said, adding that the move would lead to the dispossession of thousands of Palestinians from their land. “The process requires landowners to prove ownership in ways that are almost impossible for most Palestinians to do; if they fail, the land will be automatically registered as state land,” Peace Now asserted. This latest measure comes after Israel’s securitycabinet approved a move last weekthat expanded Israeli rule and governance over the West Bank. The move drew international condemnation, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calling it as a flagrant violation of international law and the European Union saying it is a “step in the wrong direction.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/americas/colombian-congresswoman-son-detained-by-ice-intl-latam\n",
            "A Colombian congresswoman whose conservative party is closely aligned with the right-wing ideologies of US President Donald Trump says her son was detained last month by ICE agents amid the US crackdown on immigration. Ángela Vergara says she decided to go public with the case last week in part because her son has not yet been allowed to return to Colombia despite having requested voluntary departure, but also to raise awareness about the harsh conditions Colombian immigrants are facing in the US. The case has sparked a debate online, with critics questioning why Vergara, a member of a party that often backs Trump, came out in defense of immigrants only after her son’s detention. Vergara has pushed back against the criticism, insisting that she has never supported immigration policies that she says violate human rights. “This isn’t a political issue; it’s really a human rights issue,” she told CNN. “Being a conservative politician doesn’t mean I agree with human rights violations in Colombia or anywhere else in the world.” Vergara says her son Rafael, 23, has been locked up for more than 20 days at the River Correctional Detention Center in Louisiana, in what she describes as “inhumane conditions.” She says he is being held along with a number of Colombians waiting for a repatriation flight home. “He told me that he was with 70 people in a cell, that they had gone 12 hours the day before without drinking water, (and) everyone was sick,” Vergara recounted to CNN. The congresswoman said Rafael had been detained by ICE agents after a routine inspection while driving a commercial cargo truck in Louisiana. She insists Rafael has been living in the US legally with a work permit and paying into social security. She says he applied for asylum a year after arriving in 2022 and was awaiting an asylum hearing scheduled for 2028. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for more information. After learning of her son’s arrest, Vergara said the family requested his voluntary return to Colombia, thinking it would be the quickest way to resolve the matter. But more than 20 days after his arrest, she says her son remains in detention. She attributes the delay to a “bottleneck” in the repatriation process that has left thousands of Colombians stranded in the US waiting for a limited number of flights. Colombia signed an agreement earlier this month to resume repatriation flights from the US. Foreign Minister Rosa Villavicencio said that approximately one flight per week would be carried out over the next few months. Vergara says she has asked the Colombian government to expedite transfers and increase the frequency of humanitarian flights. Vergara’s Conservative Party maintains many positions that are more aligned with the American right than with Colombia’s left-wing government led by President Gustavo Petro and has often expressed support for the Republican Party in the US. In 2024, the Colombian Conservatives “celebrated” the electoral victories of Trump and his fellow Republicans in the House and Senate. Last year, when the Trump administration decertified Colombia as a partner in the fight against drug trafficking, the partycondemned,not Trump, but Colombia’s president for criticizing the US leader. It issued a statement pledging to support the US drug fighting measures. In September, after the killing of prominent US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vergaraexpressed condolencesand support for the activist, saying, “His departure represents a loss for those of us who firmly defend life, family, and freedom.” Still, despite sharing some views with the American right, Vergara insists she doesn’t support inhumane immigration policies. “I have always demanded due process and humane treatment for Colombians, both inside and outside the country,” she recently wrote on X. Vergara says her conversative leanings have caused people to make false assumptions about her. This week, she denied being a member of the group “Latinas for Trump,” as many people online have alleged. She also denied that she celebrated the deportations of Latinos or called for a US invasion of Colombia. On Tuesday, social media users and some news outlets shared a video of a woman dancing in a MAGA hat, whom they incorrectly identified as Vergara. The video was also shared by Petro, who later took down his post after Vergara denied it was her in it. In his post, Petro had also addressed the detention of Vergara’s son and asked the Colombian Embassy in Washington to provide him with consular assistance: “No matter the paradox, the Colombian embassy in the US must help … this Colombian congresswoman to recover her son.” CNN has reached out to the Colombian presidency for comment on the matter. Vergara told CNN she thought it was positive that Petro addressed the issue but insisted that he needs to respond to her request for humanitarian flights.\n",
