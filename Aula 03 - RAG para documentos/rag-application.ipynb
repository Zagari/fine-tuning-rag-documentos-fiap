Almost 10,000 have been displaced and more than 4,500 are in temporary shelters, the civil defense said.\\n\\nAuthorities are closely monitoring dams that are not designed to handle such a high volume of water but said there is no imminent risk of failure.\\n\\nView of a flooded house at the Sarandi neighborhood in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil on May 3, 2024. Anselmo Cunha/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nBrazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with local officials overseeing the relief efforts Thursday.\\n\\n“We are witnessing a historic disaster, unfortunately,” said the state’s governor, Eduardo Leite. “The material losses are gigantic, but our focus at this moment is rescues. There are still people waiting for help.”\\n\\nImages showed muddy brown waters rising as high as rooftops in some areas, while rescue teams were out with inflatable rafts, taking people and pets on board.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, the water level in the Guaíba Lake grew five meters due to intense rains, threatening the state’s capital Porto Alegre, authorities said.\\n\\nThe Brazil Foundation, in cooperation with the Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen, has set up a fund to help victims of the floods.\\n\\nRio Grande do Sul has been increasingly hit by extreme weather events in recent years. At least 54 people died in the state in September after it endured a sub-tropical cyclone. This year’s death toll has already surpassed that record.\\n\\nThe climate crisis, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is supercharging extreme weather around the world, making many events more intense and more frequent.\\n\\nVolunteers use a fishing boat to rescue residents trapped inside their houses in São Sebastião do Cai, Rio Grande do Sul state. Anselmo Cunha/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIn the past few weeks alone, record rainfall has triggered deadly floods and brought chaos to the desert city of Dubai; reservoirs across Southeast Asia have been drying up in a persistent regional heatwave and ongoing drought, while Kenya is battling floods and heavy rainfall that has burst river banks and killed nearly 200 people.\\n\\nLast year was the hottest on record, with air and ocean temperatures climbing beyond many scientists’ predictions. The world is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in pre-industrial times.\\n\\nThe proportion of high-intensity hurricanes, or tropical cyclones, has increased due to the warmer global temperatures, according to the UN. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and are lasting longer.\\n\\nA drone view shows vehicles affected by the floods in Encantado, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, May 3, 2024.
